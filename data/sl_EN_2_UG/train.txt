In   O
Sunday   B-DATE
's   O
debate   O
against   O
Vacco   O
,   O
Spitzer   O
attacked   O
him   O
for   O
failing   O
to   O
enforce   O
a   O
court   O
order   O
in   O
1992   B-DATE
against   O
anti-abortion   O
protesters   O
who   O
had   O
blocked   O
the   O
entrance   O
to   O
a   O
clinic   O
.   O

It   O
was   O
the   O
same   O
clinic   O
where   O
Slepian   O
worked   O
.   O

A   O
federal   O
judge   O
removed   O
Vacco   O
,   O
then   O
the   O
U.S.   O
attorney   O
for   O
western   O
New   O
York   O
,   O
from   O
the   O
case   O
.   O

He   O
was   O
replaced   O
with   O
two   O
special   O
prosecutors   O
.   O

Spitzer   O
also   O
criticized   O
Vacco   O
for   O
dismantling   O
the   O
Office   O
of   O
Reproductive   O
Rights   O
,   O
which   O
investigated   O
threats   O
and   O
crimes   O
against   O
abortion   O
clinics   O
,   O
when   O
he   O
became   O
attorney   O

.   O

On   O
Monday   B-DATE
,   O
Spitzer   O
called   O
for   O
Vacco   O
to   O
revive   O
that   O
unit   O
immediately   O
,   O
vowing   O
that   O
he   O
would   O
do   O
so   O
on   O
his   O
first   B-DATE
day   I-DATE
in   O
office   O
if   O
elected   O
.   O

Goldstein   O
,   O
who   O
said   O
it   O
was   O
``   O
thoroughly   O
,   O
thoroughly   O
possible   O
''   O
that   O
the   O
issue   O
would   O
surface   O
in   O
Spitzer   O
's   O
advertisements   O
,   O
defended   O
the   O
use   O
of   O
the   O
issue   O
by   O
noting   O
that   O
the   O
attorney   O
general   O
has   O
direct   O
impact   O
on   O
the   O
issue   O
of   O

access   O
.   O

Vacco   O
's   O
campaign   O
manager   O
,   O
Matt   O
Behrmann   O
,   O
said   O
in   O
a   O
statement   O
that   O
Spitzer   O
had   O
``   O
sunk   O
to   O
a   O
new   O
and   O
despicable   O
low   O

attempting   O
to   O
capitalize   O
on   O
the   O
murder   O
of   O
a   O
physician   O
in   O
order   O
to   O
garner   O

``   O
It   O

possible   O
that   O

's   O
willingness   O
to   O
exploit   O
the   O
unfortunate   O
murder   O
of   O

a   O
steppingstone   O
for   O
his   O

political   O
ambitions   O

''   O
Berhrmann   O
said   O
.   O

Several   O
consultants   O
agreed   O
that   O
there   O
might   O
be   O
political   O
hay   O
to   O
be   O
made   O
in   O
Slepian   O

death   O

that   O
it   O
had   O
to   O
be   O
done   O
carefully   O
.   O

``   O

to   O
score   O

Finally   O
today   B-DATE
,   O
we   O
learned   O
that   O
the   O

agency   O
has   O
finally   O
taken   O
a   O
giant   O
leap   O
forward   O
.   O

Air   O
Force   O
Lieutenant   O
Colonel   O
Eileen   O
Collins   O
will   O
be   O
named   O
commander   O
of   O
the   O
Space   O
Shuttle   O
Columbia   O
for   O
a   O
mission   O
in   O
December   B-DATE

Colonel   O
Collins   O
has   O
been   O

co-pilot   O
before   O
,   O

this   O
time   O
she   O
's   O
the   O

Even   O
two   O

up   O
in   O
space   O
,   O
there   O
has   O
been   O
a   O

.   O

It   O
was   O
n't   O
until   O
twenty   B-DURATION
years   I-DURATION
after   O
the   O
first   O
astronauts   O
were   O
chosen   O
that   O
NASA   O
finally   O
included   O
six   O
women   O
,   O
and   O
they   O
were   O
all   O
scientists   O
,   O
not   O
pilots   O
.   O

No   O
woman   O
has   O
actually   O
been   O
in   O
charge   O
of   O
a   O
mission   O
until   O
now   B-DATE
.   O

Just   O
the   O
fact   O
that   O
we   O
're   O
doing   O

job   O
that   O
we   O
're   O
doing   O

That   O
was   O
Eileen   O
Collins   O
,   O
after   O
she   O
flew   O
as   O
the   O
first   O
ever   O
co-pilot   O
.   O

Being   O
commander   O
is   O
different   O
.   O

It   O
means   O
supervising   O
the   O
rest   O
of   O
the   O
crew   O
in   O
training   O
and   O
leading   O
them   O
in   O

.   O

It   O
is   O
,   O
in   O
short   O
,   O
the   O
kind   O
of   O
management   O
job   O
many   O
American   O
women   O
say   O
they've   O
had   O
to   O
fight   O
for   O
.   O

In   O
space   O
,   O
some   O
say   O
female   O
pilots   O
were   O
held   O
up   O
until   O
now   B-DATE
by   O
the   O
lack   O
of   O
piloting   O
opportunities   O
for   O
them   O
in   O
the   O
military   O
.   O

Once   O
Colonel   O
Collins   O
was   O
picked   O
as   O
a   O
NASA   O
astronaut   O
,   O
she   O
followed   O
a   O
normal   O
progression   O
within   O
NASA   O
.   O

Nobody   O
hurried   O
her   O
up   O
.   O

No   O
one   O
held   O
her   O
back   O
.   O

Many   O
NASA   O
watchers   O
say   O
female   O
astronauts   O
have   O
become   O
part   O
of   O
the   O
agency's   O
routine   O
.   O

But   O
they   O
still   O

among   O
the   O

though   O
it   O

roughly   O
off   O

Some   O
analysts   O
have   O
said   O
Courtaulds   O
'   O
moves   O
could   O
boost   O
the   O
company   O
's   O
value   O
by   O
5   O
%   O
to   O
10   O
%   O
,   O
because   O
the   O
two   O
entities   O

will   O
carry   O
a   O
higher   O
price   O
earnings   O

than   O
they   O
did   O
combined   O
.   O

In   O
addition   O
,   O
Courtaulds   O
said   O
the   O
moves   O
are   O
logical   O
because   O
they   O
will   O
allow   O
both   O
the   O
chemicals   O

focus   O
more   O

been   O
under   O

Courtaulds   O

Even   O

The   O
message   O
to   O
the   O
chief   O

be   O
taken   O
as   O
a   O
suggestion   O

offer   O

West   O
Bank   O
settlement   O

The   O
murder   O
of   O
Dr.   O

Slepian   O
is   O
the   O
latest   O
depraved   O

perform   O
legal   O

Slepian   O
was   O
one   O

only   O

performed   O
abortions   O
in   O
the   O
Buffalo   O

,   O
and   O
harassment   O
and   O
threats   O
against   O
him   O

groups   O
had   O
become   O
routine   O
over   O
the   O
past   B-DURATION
decade   I-DURATION
.   O

He   O
persevered   O
through   O
courage   O
and   O
a   O
belief   O
in   O
the   O
right   O
of   O
his   O
patients   O
to   O
choose   O
whether   O
to   O
bear   O
a   O

But   O
a   O
principled   O
commitment   O

again   O
how   O

become   O
in   O

Their   O
repeated   O
acts   O

crackdown   O
by   O
law-enforcement   O

If   O

Arson   O
and   O
bombings   O
at   O
clinics   O
have   O
become   O
so   O
common   O
that   O
many   O
no   O
longer   O
make   O
the   O
national   O
news   O
.   O

It   O
is   O
bad   O
enough   O
that   O
conservatives   O
in   O
Congress   O
and   O
in   O
state   O
legislatures   O
are   O
working   O
to   O
dismantle   O
reproductive   O
rights   O
by   O
banning   O
certain   O
procedures   O
,   O
such   O
as   O
so-called   O
partial   O
birth   O
abortion   O
,   O
and   O
by   O
requiring   O
waiting   O
periods   O
and   O
parental   O
consent   O
before   O
an   O
abortion   O
can   O
be   O
obtained   O
.   O

But   O
those   O
restrictions   O
are   O
at   O
least   O
imposed   O
by   O
the   O
normal   O
give   O
and   O
take   O
of   O
political   O
and   O
judicial   O
struggle   O
in   O
a   O
democracy   O
.   O

What   O
is   O
outrageous   O
is   O
the   O
attempt   O
to   O
shut   O
down   O
abortions   O
by   O
illegal   O
means   O
_   O
by   O
shooting   O
the   O
doctors   O

bombing   O
the   O
clinics   O

harassing   O
the   O
women   O
seeking   O
to   O
exercise   O
their   O
constitutional   O
right   O

Some   O
anti-abortion   O
groups   O
,   O
to   O
their   O
credit   O
,   O
have   O
denounced   O
the   O
bombings   O
and   O
shootings   O
,   O
but   O
others   O
seem   O
reluctant   O
to   O
issue   O
the   O
strong   O
condemnations   O
that   O
are   O
warranted   O
.   O

Indeed   O
,   O
one   O
particularly   O
virulent   O
anti-abortion   O
Web   O
site   O
lists   O
the   O
names   O

says   O

Such   O
incendiary   O
rhetoric   O
,   O
and   O
frequent   O
accusations   O
by   O
some   O
anti-abortionists   O

The   O
increase   O
of   O
anti-choice   O
laws   O
and   O
ongoing   O
campaigns   O
of   O
harassment   O
by   O

groups   O

,   O
have   O
worked   O
to   O
make   O
abortions   O
harder   O
to   O
obtain   O
.   O

More   O
than   O
80   O
percent   O
of   O
counties   O
in   O
this   O
country   O
have   O
no   O

In   O
45   O
states   O
,   O
the   O
number   O

Unless   O

Not   O
all   O
Cubans   O
believe   O
,   O
but   O
Castro   O
has   O
invited   O
everyone   O
to   O
welcome   O
the   O
man   O
who   O
has   O
been   O
one   O
of   O
Communism   O

most   O
effective   O
adversaries   O

and   O
that   O
's   O
why   O
there   O
is   O
suspense   O

Everyone   O
appears   O
to   O
believe   O
that   O
somehow   O
Cuba   O
is   O
going   O
to   O
change   O

Castro   O

Reading   O
from   O
Cuban   O
intelligence   O
documents   O
on   O
state   O
television   O
,   O
Castro   O
said   O
a   O
group   O
of   O
Cuban-Americans   O
in   O
Miami   O
was   O
studying   O
the   O
possibility   O
of   O
taking   O
Elian   O
and   O
his   O
Miami   O
relatives   O
to   O
a   O
third   O
nation   O
,   O
probably   O
Nicaragua   O
or   O
Costa   O
Rica   O
.   O

Castro   O
said   O
his   O
government   O
had   O
shared   O
its   O
concerns   O
with   O
the   O
U.S.   O
State   O
Department   O
about   O
the   O
possibility   O
of   O
such   O
a   O
move   O
``   O
which   O
could   O
cause   O
damage   O
not   O
only   O
to   O
a   O
child   O
,   O
but   O
to   O
the   O
reputation   O
of   O
the   O
United   O
States   O
.   O
''   O

A   O
State   O
Department   O
duty   O
officer   O
said   O
she   O
had   O
no   O
information   O
on   O
a   O
threat   O
to   O
Elian   O
and   O
was   O
unaware   O
of   O
Castro   O
's   O
remarks   O
.   O

In   O
Miami   O
,   O
the   O
boy   O
's   O
great-uncle   O
,   O
Lazaro   O
Gonzalez   O
,   O
denied   O
that   O
he   O
would   O
send   O
Elian   O
out   O
of   O
the   O
country   O
,   O
or   O
that   O
he   O
himself   O
would   O
leave   O

''It   O
never   O
even   O
entered   O
my   O
mind   O
,   O
''   O
he   O
said   O
.   O

''This   O
is   O
my   O
home   O
.   O
''   O

The   O
Cuban   O
leader   O
first   O
raised   O
those   O
worries   O
during   O
another   O
live   O
television   O
appearance   O
Sunday   B-DATE
night   I-DATE
during   O
a   O
speech   O
to   O
about   O
700   O
Cuban   O
university   O
students   O
.   O

But   O
it   O
was   O
not   O
until   O
Tuesday   B-DATE
that   O
Castro   O
revealed   O
that   O
those   O
concerns   O
had   O
been   O
shared   O
directly   O
with   O
the   O
U.S.   O
government   O

While   O
the   O
expansion   O
of   O
the   O

has   O
been   O
a   O
blessing   O
for   O

the   O

mentioned   O

also   O
being   O
used   O
by   O
some   O
rather   O
unsavory   O
characters   O
.   O

A   O
new   O

says   O
there   O
has   O
been   O

And   O
many   O

are   O
using   O

The   O
new   O

written   O

edits   O
the   O
Southern   O
Poverty   O
Law   O
Center   O
's   O
Intelligence   O
Report   O
,   O
warns   O
that   O
such   O
groups   O
grew   O
rapidly   O
last   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
,   O
mostly   O
by   O
recruiting   O
younger   O
members   O
.   O

Mr.   O
Potach   O
says   O
the   O
growth   O
is   O
surprising   O
since   O
membership   O
in   O
hate   O
groups   O
usually   O
declines   O
during   O
periods   O
of   O
economic   O
prosperity   O
.   O

We   O
in   O
fact   O
have   O
seen   O
hate   O
group   O
numbers   O
dropping   O
through   O
the   B-DATE
nineties   I-DATE
,   O
uh   O
but   O
this   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
they   O
jumped   O
up   O
uh   O
twenty   O
percent   O
,   O
quite   O
a   O
dramatic   O
rise   O
.   O

Mark   O
Potach   O
says   O
over   O
four   O
hundred   O
hate   O
groups   O
have   O
been   O
identified   O
and   O
many   O
are   O
becoming   O
increasingly   O
successful   O
at   O
recruiting   O
younger   O
members   O
through   O
the   O
use   O
of   O
Internet   O
web   O
pages   O
and   O
the   O
promotion   O
of   O
racist   O
rock   O
music   O
.   O

The   O
Internet   O
has   O
certainly   O
helped   O
uh   O
hate   O
mongers   O
to   O
organize   O
and   O
uh   O
to   O
feel   O
that   O
they   O
are   O
part   O
of   O
a   O
larger   O
community   O
,   O
even   O
if   O
uh   O
they   O
are   O
essentially   O
uh   O
,   O
you   O
know   O
,   O
angry   O
people   O
sitting   O
in   O
their   O
bedrooms   O
uh   O
all   O
alone   O
.   O

Uh   O
,   O
in   O
addition   O
,   O
white   O
power   O
racist   O
music   O
has   O
become   O
uh   O
quite   O
popular   O
in   O
certain   O
sectors   O
.   O

Uh   O
,   O
there   O
are   O
over   O
fifty   O
thousand   O
CDs   O
a   B-SET
year   I-SET
sold   O
with   O
uh   O
lyrics   O
that   O
are   O
quite   O
uh   O
unbelievable   O
.   O

Many   O
of   O
these   O
new   O
members   O
are   O
joining   O
chapters   O
of   O
the   O
so   O
called   O
Christian   O
Identity   O
Movement   O
which   O
cites   O
Biblical   O
scripture   O
as   O
a   O
foundation   O
for   O
a   O
belief   O
in   O
white   O
supremacy   O
and   O
anti-semitism   O
.   O

Mark   O
Potach   O
says   O
such   O
members   O
are   O
also   O
intensely   O
attracted   O
to   O
apocalyptical   O
fantasies   O
.   O

The   O
approach   O
of   O
the   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
two   I-DATE
thousand   I-DATE
has   O
many   O
of   O
these   O
groups   O
in   O
a   O
kind   O
of   O
millennial   O
frenzy   O
.   O

Uh   O
,   O
uh   O
a-   O
they   O
believe   O
,   O
or   O
at   O
least   O
many   O
of   O
them   O
believe   O
,   O
uh   O
that   O
they   O
are   O
approaching   O
the   O
Battle   O
of   O
Armageddon   O
in   O
which   O
they   O
will   O
be   O
pitted   O
against   O
the   O
uh   O
kind   O
of   O
Satanic   O
forces   O
trying   O
to   O
take   O
over   O
the   O
world   O
.   O

Mr.   O
Potach   O
notes   O
older   O
,   O
more   O
traditional   O
groups   O
like   O
the   O
Ku   O

are   O
also   O
opening   O
new   O
chapters   O

thanks   O
in   O

to   O
their   O
ability   O

use   O

the   O

The   O

bit   O
of   O

Iraq   O

in   O
less   B-DURATION

The   O

the   O
American   O

have   O
frightened   O
away   O

The   O

The   O

has   O
responded   O
to   O
the   O

with   O
a   O
series   O
of   O
actions   O
to   O
lure   O

a   O

KLM   O

The   O
bombing   O
will   O
doubtless   O
set   O
back   O
those   O
efforts   O

never   O

the   O

all   O
across   O
Asia   O
means   O
that   O

that   O
the   O

for   O

it   O

To   O
either   O

Meissner   O
said   O
the   O
INS   O
decision   O
was   O
made   O
after   O
two   O

said   O
is   O
anxious   O
to   O
have   O
Elian   O

him   O

Since   O
the   O

is   O
so   O
young   O
,   O
Meissner   O
said   O
,   O
the   O
natural   O
father   O
has   O
the   O
right   O

There   O
is   O
``   O

that   O
Gonzalez   O
,   O

was   O
divorced   O
from   O
Elian's   O

,   O
is   O
an   O
unfit   O

,   O
nor   O
that   O
he   O

been   O
coerced   O
by   O
the   O

into   O
pleading   O

,   O
an   O

for   O
the   O

in   O

were   O

``   O

''   O

Meissner   O
gave   O
no   O
reason   O
for   O
the   O
Jan   O

14   O
deadline   O
,   O
and   O
it   O
is   O
still   O
unclear   O
how   O
Elian   O
would   O
be   O
transported   O
back   O
to   O
Cuba   O
if   O
the   O
Gonzalez   O
family   O
's   O
appeals   O
are   O
unsuccessful   O
.   O

The   O
INS   O
offered   O
three   O
options   O
:   O
that   O
Gonzalez   O
come   O
to   O
pick   O
up   O
his   O
son   O
,   O
that   O
the   O
family   O
in   O
Miami   O
take   O
him   O
to   O
Cuba   O
,   O
or   O
that   O
a   O
``   O
third   O
party   O
''   O
escort   O
the   O
child   O
to   O
his   O
homeland   O

Gonzalez   O
_   O
perhaps   O
under   O
duress   O
from   O
the   O
Castro   O
regime   O
_   O
has   O
indicated   O
he   O
does   O
not   O
want   O
to   O
travel   O
to   O
Miami   O
,   O
and   O
there   O
is   O
``   O
no   O
way   O
''   O
the   O
Miami   O
Gonzalezes   O
will   O
assist   O
in   O
sending   O
Elian   O
back   O
to   O

,   O
Perez   O
said   O
.   O

Having   O
a   O
third   O
party   O
escort   O
Elian   O
frees   O
the   O
INS   O
from   O
the   O

uncomfortable   O
spectacle   O
of   O

the   O

itself   O

The   O
Cuban-American   O

is   O
a   O
locally   O
powerful   O
political   O
force   O
few   O
politicians   O
want   O
to   O
provoke   O

to   O
distance   O
himself   O
from   O
the   O

:   O

Juan   O
Miguel   O
Gonzalez   O
has   O
made   O
the   O
right   O
decision   O
to   O
travel   O
to   O
the   O
United   O
States   O
on   O
Thursday   B-DATE
to   O
affirm   O
his   O
desire   O
to   O
be   O
reunited   O
with   O
his   O
son   O
,   O
Elian   O
.   O

His   O
presence   O
on   O
American   O
soil   O
is   O
necessary   O
to   O
dispel   O
doubts   O
about   O
his   O
fitness   O
as   O
a   O
father   O
_   O
raised   O
maliciously   O
by   O
Elian   O
's   O
Miami   O
relatives   O
_   O
and   O
to   O
end   O
speculation   O
that   O
he   O
is   O
indifferent   O
about   O
reclaiming   O
custody   O
of   O
his   O
son   O
.   O

With   O
Gonzalez   O
all   O
but   O
out   O
of   O
sight   O
in   O
Cuba   O
,   O
the   O
relatives   O
have   O
had   O
a   O
free   O
hand   O
to   O
distort   O
the   O
case   O
with   O
bogus   O
legal   O
arguments   O
and   O
unsubstantiated   O
claims   O
that   O
Elian   O
is   O
afraid   O
to   O
see   O
his   O
father   O
.   O

The   O
relatives   O
are   O
obviously   O
fond   O
of   O
Elian   O
,   O
though   O
their   O
judgment   O
has   O
clearly   O
been   O
clouded   O
by   O
their   O
animosity   O
toward   O
Fidel   O
Castro   O
,   O
the   O
Cuban   O
leader   O
.   O

Once   O
Gonzalez   O
comes   O
to   O
the   O
United   O
States   O
_   O
it   O
would   O
be   O
preferable   O
if   O
he   O
went   O
to   O
Miami   O
rather   O
than   O
to   O
Washington   O
_   O
only   O
the   O
most   O
obdurate   O
foes   O
of   O
Castro   O
can   O
argue   O
that   O
Elian   O
should   O
not   O
be   O
reunited   O
with   O
him   O
.   O

Gonzalez   O
's   O
arrival   O
should   O
also   O
help   O
clear   O
the   O
way   O
for   O
the   O
Justice   O
Department   O
to   O
make   O
arrangements   O
to   O
transfer   O
custody   O
of   O
the   O
child   O
.   O

The   O
Miami   O
relatives   O
have   O
left   O
unclear   O
whether   O
they   O
will   O
willingly   O
relinquish   O
custody   O
of   O
Elian   O
,   O
and   O
have   O
done   O
their   O
best   O
to   O
stir   O
passions   O
against   O
the   O
Justice   O
Department   O
among   O
Cuban-Americans   O
in   O
South   O
Florida   O
.   O

In   O
hopes   O
of   O
trumping   O
the   O
law   O
,   O
they   O
have   O
unreasonably   O
demanded   O
that   O
a   O
panel   O
of   O
child   O
psychologists   O
determine   O
Elian   O
's   O
fate   O
.   O

The   O
best   O
outcome   O
would   O
be   O
for   O
the   O
relatives   O
to   O
turn   O
Elian   O
over   O
to   O
his   O
father   O
as   O
soon   O
as   O
Gonzalez   O
arrives   O
,   O
and   O
to   O
do   O
so   O
in   O
a   O
spirit   O
of   O
kinship   O
that   O
makes   O
the   O
transition   O
as   O
smooth   O
as   O
possible   O
for   O
Elian   O
.   O

Once   O
that   O
happens   O
,   O
Gonzalez   O
and   O
Elian   O
,   O
though   O
technically   O
free   O
to   O
return   O
to   O
Cuba   O
,   O
should   O
remain   O
here   O
to   O
await   O
an   O
appellate   O
court   O
ruling   O
on   O
the   O
case   O
,   O
which   O
is   O
expected   O
next   B-DATE
month   I-DATE
.   O

But   O
if   O
the   O
relatives   O
balk   O
,   O
the   O
Justice   O
Department   O
should   O
quickly   O
revoke   O
their   O
custody   O
of   O
the   O
child   O
and   O
obtain   O
a   O
federal   O
court   O
order   O
instructing   O
them   O
and   O
their   O
lawyers   O
to   O
turn   O
Elian   O
over   O
to   O
his   O
father   O
.   O

The   O
relatives   O
may   O
be   O
less   O
defiant   O
if   O
they   O
are   O
held   O
in   O
contempt   O
of   O
court   O
.   O

If   O
a   O
court   O
edict   O
fails   O
to   O
compel   O
compliance   O
,   O
the   O
Justice   O
Department   O
will   O
have   O
to   O
consider   O
sterner   O
measures   O
,   O
for   O
the   O
relatives   O
will   O
then   O
be   O
resisting   O
the   O
rule   O
of   O
law   O
as   O
defined   O
by   O
both   O
the   O
department   O
and   O
the   O
courts   O
.   O

But   O
Washington   O
ought   O
not   O
to   O
rush   O
to   O
take   O
Elian   O
forcibly   O
from   O
the   O
relatives   O
.   O

That   O
course   O
would   O
be   O
psychologically   O
wounding   O
to   O
the   O
boy   O
,   O
and   O
could   O
lead   O
to   O
a   O
violent   O
confrontation   O
with   O
demonstrators   O
who   O
gather   O
daily   B-DATE
outside   O
the   O
relatives   O
'   O
home   O
.   O

The   O
government   O
yields   O
none   O
of   O
its   O
legal   O
or   O
moral   O
authority   O
in   O
the   O
case   O
if   O
it   O
gives   O
the   O
relatives   O
and   O
their   O
supporters   O
time   O
to   O
reflect   O
and   O
to   O
look   O
for   O
a   O
gentler   O
resolution   O
.   O

As   O
a   O
matter   O
of   O
law   O
,   O
compassion   O
and   O
common   O
sense   O
,   O
the   O
government   O
is   O
entitled   O
to   O
reunite   O
Elian   O
with   O
his   O
father   O
,   O
and   O
it   O
has   O
the   O
power   O
to   O
enforce   O
that   O
right   O
,   O
despite   O
the   O
bluster   O
of   O
Miami   O

political   O
leaders   O

But   O
for   O
now   B-DATE
,   O
everyone   O
involved   O
should   O
be   O
searching   O
for   O
an   O

State   O

about   O
a   O

Citing   O
an   O

Derek   O

a   O
spokesman   O
for   O
the   O

suspects   O

But   O
over   O
all   O

arrests   O
were   O
made   O
in   O
more   O
than   O
60   O

,   O
he   O
said   O
.   O

Eight   O
of   O
the   O
14   O

one   O
was   O

said   O
,   O
and   O
these   O
different   O
methods   O
of   O
killing   O
and   O
other   O
evidence   O
seem   O
to   O
indicate   O
that   O
the   O
eight   O

with   O
the   O

draw   O
any   O

conclusions   O

leaving   O

the   O

The   O
Cuban   O

said   O
that   O
the   O

still   O
did   O
not   O

how   O
it   O
would   O

that   O
it   O
would   O
happen   O
quickly   O

The   O
U.S.   O

from   O
the   O

The   O

But   O
Gonzalez   O
,   O
backed   O
by   O

has   O
demanded   O
his   O
rights   O
as   O
Elian   O
's   O
sole   O
surviving   O
parent   O
and   O
insisted   O
that   O
the   O

During   O

to   O
survival   O
.   O

Ms.   O
Atimadi   O
says   O
the   O
war   O
has   O
created   O
a   O
nation   O
of   O
widows   O
.   O

Women   O
have   O
become   O
the   O
sole   O
support   O
of   O
their   O
families   O
.   O

Yet   O
,   O
the   O
Taliban   O
have   O
forbidden   O
them   O
to   O
work   O
.   O

She   O
says   O
this   O
puts   O
the   O
very   O
existence   O
of   O
women   O
's   O
families   O
at   O
risk   O
.   O

She   O
says   O
the   O
plight   O
of   O
women   O
in   O
urban   O
areas   O
is   O
greater   O
than   O
that   O
which   O
exists   O
in   O
rural   O
parts   O
of   O
the   O
country   O
.   O

In   O
cities   O
,   O
such   O
as   O
the   O
capital   O
Kabul   O
,   O
women   O
are   O
totally   O
dependent   O
on   O
international   O
aid   O
for   O
survival   O
.   O

Ms.   O
Atimadi   O
says   O
the   O
women   O
of   O
Kabul   O
symbolize   O
the   O
suffering   O
of   O
all   O
the   O
women   O
in   O
Afghanistan   O
.   O

The   O
aim   O
is   O
to   O
bring   O
in   O
not   O
only   O
the   O
focus   O
on   O
women   O
's   O
right   O
to   O
education   O
,   O
access   O
to   O
work   O
,   O
but   O
look   O
beyond   O
that   O
and   O
look   O
at   O
the   O
roots   O
of   O
,   O
uh   O
of   O
these   O
problems   O
.   O

These   O
are   O
only   O
the   O
symptoms   O
of   O
the   O
problems   O
that   O
are   O
facing   O
Afghanistan   O
.   O

For   O
women   O
in   O
Afghanistan   O
to   O
be   O
able   O
to   O
realize   O
their   O
rights   O
,   O
there   O
have   O
to   O
be   O
conditions   O
of   O
peace   O
and   O
justice   O
.   O

Ms.   O
Atimadi   O
says   O
that   O
is   O
the   O
primary   O
focus   O
of   O
her   O
group   O
,   O
peace   O
and   O
justice   O
.   O

She   O
says   O
her   O
group   O
is   O
appealing   O
to   O
individuals   O
,   O
to   O
the   O
international   O
community   O
,   O
and   O
to   O
the   O
combatants   O
and   O
people   O
of   O
Afghanistan   O
to   O
stop   O
the   O
bloodletting   O
which   O
has   O
torn   O
the   O

The   O
US   O
government   O
recently   O
announced   O
new   O
regulations   O
designed   O
to   O
change   O
the   O
way   O
transplant   O
organs   O
are   O
made   O
available   O
to   O
sick   O
patients   O
.   O

Under   O
the   O
new   O
guidelines   O
,   O
donor   O
organs   O
will   O
be   O
made   O
available   O
to   O
the   O
sickest   O
people   O
first   O
,   O
wherever   O
they   O
live   O
in   O
the   O
country   O
.   O

Currently   O
,   O
transplant   O
organs   O
are   O
rationed   O
through   O
a   O
regional   O
system   O
of   O
distribution   O
.   O

The   O
private   O
group   O
that   O
runs   O
the   O
current   O
system   O
,   O
United   O
Network   O
for   O
Organ   O
Sharing   O
,   O
or   O
UNOS   O
,   O
objects   O
to   O
the   O
new   O
regulations   O
.   O

UNOS   O
says   O
the   O
regulations   O
put   O
the   O
federal   O
government   O
in   O
charge   O
of   O
deciding   O
who   O
gets   O
transplants   O
and   O
that   O
many   O
hospital   O
transplant   O
centers   O
would   O
be   O
forced   O
to   O
close   O
.   O

Health   O
and   O
Human   O
Services   O
Secretary   O
Do-   O
Donna   O
Shalala   O
says   O
patients   O
who   O
need   O
an   O
organ   O
transplant   O
should   O
not   O
have   O
to   O
take   O
a   O
chance   O
that   O
an   O
organ   O
will   O
become   O
available   O
in   O
their   O
local   O
area   O
,   O
nor   O
should   O
patients   O
have   O
to   O
travel   O
to   O
transplant   O
centers   O
far   O
from   O
their   O
homes   O
to   O
improve   O
their   O
chances   O
of   O
getting   O
an   O
organ   O
.   O

UNOS   O
spokeswoman   O
Donna   O
Henry   O
Wright   O
says   O
the   O
new   O
policy   O
would   O
not   O
necessarily   O
be   O
more   O
fair   O
or   O
effective   O
because   O
allowances   O
are   O
already   O
made   O
for   O
the   O
most   O
needy   O
patients   O
.   O

The   O
sickest   O
patients   O
are   O
already   O
treated   O
first   O
.   O

There   O
are   O
not   O
huge   O
waiting   O
uh   O
disparit-   O
waiting   O
time   O
disparities   O
amongst   O
the   O
very   O
uh   O
sickest   O
patients   O
.   O

It   O
's   O
between   O
two   B-DURATION
to   O
six   B-DURATION
days   I-DURATION
for   O
every   O
one   O
uh   O
of   O
the   O
sickest   O
patients   O
across   O
the   O
country   O
.   O

um   O
So   O
it   O
's   O
a-   O
it   O
's   O
a   O
fallacy   O
that   O
they   O
're   O
doing   O
this   O
because   O
um   O
the   O
sickest   O
patients   O
are   O
n't   O
being   O
served   O
.   O

Doctor   O
James   O

at   O
Johns   O
Hopkins   O

Baltimore   O
,   O
Maryland   O
,   O
and   O
former   O
President   O
of   O
UNOS   O
,   O
said   O
the   O
current   O
system   O
has   O
evolved   O
over   O
several   B-DURATION
years   I-DURATION
and   O
it   O
works   O
well   O
.   O

You   O
may   O
,   O
in   O
a   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
or   I-DATE
two   I-DATE
,   O
save   O
a   O
few   O
more   O
lives   O
if   O
you   O
do   O
sickest   O
first   O
.   O

But   O
the   O
number   O
of   O
patients   O
waiting   O
then   O
begins   O
to   O
increase   O
,   O
um   O
and   O
,   O
in   O
fact   O
,   O
um   O
over   O
the   B-DURATION
years   I-DURATION
many   O
more   O
patients   O
who   O
are   O
about   O
to   O
die   O
of   O
liver   O
tra-   O
uh   O
without   O
a   O
liver   O
transplant   O
would   O
accumulate   O
.   O

If   O
you   O
do   O
the   O
uh   O
alternative   O
extreme   O
,   O
you   O
do   O
n't   O
save   O
as   O
many   O
lives   O
in   O
the   B-DURATION
early   I-DURATION
years   I-DURATION
,   O
by   O
a   O
small   O
fraction   O
.   O

Our   O
system   O
is   O
balanced   O
,   O
it   O
's   O
right   O
in   O
the   O
middle   O
.   O

And   O
,   O
therefore   O
,   O
it   O
works   O
very   O
well   O
.   O

Nationwide   O
,   O
there   O
are   O
about   O
ten   O
thousand   O
patients   O
waiting   O
for   O
liver   O
transplants   O
each   B-SET
year   I-SET
and   O
only   O
four   O
thousand   O
organs   O
become   O
available   O
for   O
transplants   O
.   O

Secretary   O
Shalala   O
says   O
UNOS   O
five   B-DATE
months   I-DATE
ago   I-DATE
,   O
or   O
gave   O
them   O
five   B-DURATION
months   I-DURATION
to   O
develop   O
a   O
new   O
plan   O
to   O
distribute   O
livers   O
which   O
are   O
in   O
the   O
shortest   O
supply   O

a   B-DURATION

for   O
more   O

Ah   O
yes   O
,   O

It-   O
It   O
just   O
blew   O
up   O
in   O
the   O

then   O
we   O

,   O
many   O
of   O
the   O

wear   O
head   O

and   O
some   O
of   O
the   O
neatly   O
dressed   O
children   O
are   O
in   O
uniforms   O
.   O

The   O
instruction   O
is   O
in   O
English   O
for   O
most   O
classes   O
,   O
in   O
Arabic   O
for   O
language   O
and   O
religious   O
studies   O
.   O

The   O
school   O
says   O
it   O
teaches   O
the   O
children   O
to   O
be   O
good   O
Muslims   O
and   O
good   O
students   O
.   O

They   O
're   O
learning   O
a   O
civics   O
lesson   O
from   O
the   O
residents   O
of   O
Loudon   O
county   O

The   O
Islamic   O
Saudi   O
Academy   O
has   O
twelve   O
hundred   O
mostly   O
American   O
students   O
but   O
would   O
take   O
thirty-five   O
hundred   O
if   O
it   O
had   O
the   O
room   O

The   O

a   O
hundred   O
acres   O
in   O
Loudon   O

There   O
is   O

a-   O
at   O
a   O
very   O
deep   O
level   O
in   O
our   O

,   O
um   O
I   O
think   O
,   O
a   O
sense   O
of   O
,   O
of   O
ignorance   O
about   O
Islam   O
,   O
a   O
fear   O
about   O
who   O
Muslims   O
are   O
and   O
what   O
they   O
're   O
doing   O
.   O

Many   O
local   O

denounced   O
the   O
bigotry   O
,   O
but   O
opposition   O
to   O
the   O
school   O
then   O
shifted   O

Now   B-DATE
critics   O
of   O

has   O
a   O

with   O
a   O

school   O
.   O

The   O
Saudi   O
Arabian   O
government   O
has   O
an   O
atrocious   O
record   O
on   O
human   O
rights   O
and   O
is   O
known   O
to   O
be   O
one   O
of   O
the   O
worst   O
offending   O
countries   O
when   O
it   O
comes   O
to   O
religious   O
persecution   O
.   O

That   O
's   O
correct   O
.   O

And   O
that   O
is   O
a   O
condition   O
of   O
the   O
application   O
,   O
then   O
.   O

At   O
a   O
public   O
hearing   O
on   O
the   O
Islamic   O
Saudi   O
Academy   O
's   O
application   O
,   O
the   O
split   O
in   O
county   O
opinion   O
was   O
obvious   O
,   O
supporters   O
of   O
the   O
academy   O
,   O
including   O
Ann   O
Robinson   O
,   O
said   O
the   O
Saudis   O
were   O
just   O
providing   O
a   O
service   O
and   O
it   O
was   O
unfair   O
to   O
penalize   O
children   O
.   O

We   O
do   O
not   O
further   O
the   O
purpose   O
of   O
human   O
rights   O
in   O
the   O
world   O
by   O
violating   O
the   O
human   O
rights   O
under   O
our   O
own   O
constitution   O
.   O

But   O
opponents   O
said   O
the   O
school   O
might   O
be   O
a   O
target   O
for   O
terrorist   O
attacks   O
,   O
complained   O
about   O
its   O
tax   O
exempt   O
status   O
,   O
and   O
wondered   O
why   O
the   O
Saudis   O
are   O
not   O
compelled   O
to   O
allow   O
Christians   O
to   O
worship   O
in   O
their   O

the   O

send   O

getting   O
the   O

The   O

The   O
Bureau   O
of   O
Labor   O

said   O
the   O

added   O
358,000   O

the   O

generation   O
has   O
been   O
exceptionally   O
strong   O
.   O

With   O
growing   O
opportunities   O
for   O
work   O
drawing   O
more   O
people   O
into   O
the   O
labor   O

,   O
the   O
unemployment   O
rate   O
remained   O
at   O
4.7   O

,   O
just   O
a   O
notch   O
above   O
its   O
quarter-century   O
low   O
.   O

The   O
demand   O
for   O
workers   O
also   O
led   O
employers   O
to   O
raise   O
wages   O
again   O
last   B-DATE

.   O

Average   O
hourly   B-SET
earnings   O

rose   O
4   O
cents   O

to   O

The   O
gain   O
left   O
wages   O
3.8   O
percent   O
higher   O
than   O
a   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
earlier   I-DATE
,   O
extending   O
a   O
trend   O
that   O
has   O
given   O
back   O
to   O
workers   O
some   O
of   O
the   O

power   O
they   O
lost   O
to   O
inflation   O
in   O
the   B-DATE
last   I-DATE
decade   I-DATE
.   O

But   O
economists   O
said   O
the   O
wage   O
increase   O
was   O
not   O
enough   O
to   O
raise   O
any   O
concerns   O
about   O
higher   O
inflation   O

And   O
because   O
the   O

it   O

disregarded   O
the   O

betting   O
that   O
neither   O
a   O
rise   O

resurgent   O

The   O

Some   O
of   O
the   O
biggest   O

came   O
in   O
the   O
construction   O
industry   O

which   O
added   O
92,000   O
jobs   O
in   O
January   B-DATE

The   O

reflected   O
the   O
strength   O
of   O
the   O

which   O
has   O
been   O
helped   O

also   O
by   O

The   O
major   O
harm   O
from   O

of   O
many   O

a   O
situation   O

a   O

of   O

imports   O
into   O
the   O

hurting   O
American   O
competitors   O

And   O
the   O
weakness   O
of   O
the   O
Asian   O

is   O
also   O
likely   O
to   O
lead   O

The   O
enlargement   O
of   O
NATO   O
from   O
16   O
members   O
to   O
19   O
has   O
been   O
one   O
of   O
the   O
administration   O
's   O
foremost   O
foreign   O
policy   O
goals   O
,   O
one   O
that   O
grew   O
out   O
of   O
a   O
desire   O

its   O
proponents   O
said   O

to   O
cement   O
the   O

in   O
the   O

But   O
the   O
policy   O
also   O
faced   O
critics   O
,   O
who   O
argued   O
that   O
welcoming   O
these   O
three   O
new   O
countries   O
would   O
draw   O
a   O
new   O
line   O
across   O
Europe   O

antagonize   O
the   O
Russians   O

As   O
of   O
Friday   B-DATE
,   O
the   O
border   O
between   O
Western   O
Europe   O

the   O

In   O
her   O
speech   O

the   O
small   O

dignitaries   O
from   O

on   O
the   O

Albright   O
countered   O
that   O

now   O
do   O
``   O

''   O

Albright   O
also   O
used   O
her   O
speech   O
to   O
articulate   O
a   O
forward-looking   O
vision   O
for   O
NATO   O
,   O
which   O
will   O
celebrate   O
its   O
50th   O

and   O
to   O
defend   O

.   O

In   O
the   O
aftermath   O
of   O
the   O
Cold   O
War   O
,   O
she   O
said   O
,   O
NATO   O
must   O
be   O
ready   O
to   O

we   O

a   O

''   O

The   O
NATO   O
summit   O
,   O
she   O
said   O
,   O
would   O
produce   O
an   O
initiative   O
that   O
``   O

Slobodan   O
Milosevic   O
,   O
is   O
resisting   O
the   O

NATO-led   O
troops   O
,   O
including   O
4,000   O
U.S.   O
soldiers   O
,   O
Albright   O
insisted   O
that   O
NATO   O
was   O
the   O
best   O
tool   O
to   O
enforce   O
a   O
peace   O
settlement   O
.   O

``   O
We   O
must   O
be   O
clear   O
in   O
explaining   O
that   O
a   O
settlement   O
without   O
NATO-led   O
enforcement   O
is   O
not   O
acceptable   O
because   O
only   O

the   O
credibility   O
and   O
capability   O
to   O
make   O
it   O

she   O
said   O

``   O

out   O

of   O
intransigence   O

she   O
added   O
,   O
referring   O
to   O
the   O
threat   O
of   O
NATO   O

he   O
does   O
not   O

in   O
many   O

who   O
in   O
order   O

meet   O

have   O
had   O
to   O
cut   O
the   O

organize   O

spiritual   O

all   O
three   O

Geremek   O
said   O
he   O
had   O
brought   O
some   O
appropriate   O
mementoes   O
from   O

had   O
remained   O
buoyant   O
during   O
his   O
opposition   O

an   O
emigre   O
by   O
believing   O
that   O

he   O
never   O

that   O
his   O

the   O

the   O

a   O
13-year-old   O

the   O
fairly   O
unorthodox   O
decision   O
to   O
choose   O
a   O

Formed   O
in   O
reaction   O
to   O
the   O
threat   O
of   O

Soviet   O

,   O
NATO   O
calls   O
for   O
the   O
collective   O
defense   O
of   O

was   O
brought   O
into   O

with   O
an   O
original   O
12   O
members   O

The   O
alliance   O
has   O
expanded   O
three   O

The   O

on   O
the   O
expansion   O

These   O
conversations   O
are   O
remembered   O
by   O
Clinton   O

foreign   O
policy   O

took   O
place   O
after   O
the   O
opening   O
of   O
the   O
Holocaust   O

because   O
they   O
involved   O
two   O

different   O
Central   O
European   O
leaders   O
who   O
brought   O
the   O
same   O
message   O

Their   O
message   O
was   O
that   O
NATO   O

the   O
mechanism   O
to   O
secure   O
the   O
democratic   O
progress   O

countries   O

how   O

with   O
the   O

vacillated   O
between   O

But   O
in   O
order   O
to   O
accommodate   O
the   O
Russians   O

created   O
the   O

said   O
Alarcon   O

The   O
concern   O
in   O
Cuba   O
always   O
has   O
been   O
that   O
if   O

goes   O
he   O

did   O

back   O
down   O

In   O
a   O

where   O
expressing   O
even   O
the   O
slightest   O
approval   O
for   O

prompt   O
threats   O

Manuel   O
Gonzalez   O
filed   O
a   O
motion   O

for   O

reunite   O
the   O
boy   O

It   O
was   O
a   O
move   O
that   O
many   O
see   O
as   O
courageous   O

principled   O
,   O

``   O

stop   O
the   O

on   O
Miami's   O
ubiquitous   O
Spanish-language   O
radio   O

which   O
buzzed   O
with   O

lambasting   O
Gonzalez   O
for   O
playing   O
into   O
the   O
hands   O
of   O
a   O
tyrant   O

A   O

on   O
the   O
steps   O
of   O

the   O
family   O
has   O
overcome   O
steep   O
obstacles   O

Long   O
before   O

them   O
into   O

unrelenting   O
glare   O
of   O
the   O

of   O
the   O
conflicts   O
and   O
painful   O
separations   O
wrought   O
by   O
the   O
Cuban   O
revolution   O

the   O
nine   O
brothers   O

the   O

worked   O
as   O

officer   O
in   O
a   O
Cuban   O
ministry   O
,   O
a   O

he   O
said   O

For   O
decades   O
,   O
Cuban   O
Americans   O
in   O
Miami   O

largely   O
cut   O
off   O
from   O
the   O

left   O

Labeled   O
``   O

The   O
situation   O
began   O
to   O
relax   O
in   O
the   O
early   B-DATE
1990s   I-DATE

with   O
the   O

the   O
end   O
of   O
the   O

In   O
desperate   O
need   O
of   O
hard   O
currency   O
,   O
Castro   O
relaxed   O
travel   O
restrictions   O
and   O
allowed   O
Cubans   O
to   O
have   O
U.S.   O
dollars   O
,   O
triggering   O
a   O
trickle   O
of   O
cash   O
from   O
Miami   O
that   O
soon   O
became   O
a   O
flood   O

''   O

Prior   O
to   O
Elian   O
,   O
the   O
Gonzalez   O
family   O
apparently   O
was   O
no   O
different   O

The   O

the   O
family   O
regularly   O
talked   O
by   O

and   O
the   O

went   O
back   O
to   O

for   O
several   O
family   O

But   O
Elian   O

has   O
broken   O
down   O
the   O

truce   O

between   O

government   O
and   O
exile   O
extremists   O
in   O
Miami   O
.   O

After   O
making   O
his   O
opinions   O
known   O
,   O
Manuel   O
Gonzalez   O
reportedly   O
was   O
ostracized   O
by   O
his   O
Miami   O
kin   O
,   O
especially   O
Lazaro   O
,   O
who   O
has   O

to   O

to   O
try   O

the   O

there   O
has   O

Lazaro's   O
home   O
to   O
try   O
to   O
work   O
out   O
their   O
differences   O

Neither   O
side   O
would   O
say   O
what   O
happened   O
,   O
but   O
when   O
Manuel   O
returned   O
to   O
his   O
house   O
,   O
he   O
was   O
so   O
upset   O
he   O
felt   O
heart   O
palpitations   O
and   O
was   O
taken   O
to   O
a   O
hospital   O

He   O
was   O
soon   O
released   O
and   O
appeared   O
to   O
be   O
reasonably   O
healthy   O

,   O

It   O
's   O
not   O
enough   O

Calling   O

Elian   O
Gonzalez   O
``   O
an   O

``   O
practically   O
kidnapped   O

by   O
the   O

perished   O
along   O

her   O
on   O
the   O
boat   O

6-year-old   O

.   O

Castro   O
's   O
remarks   O
to   O
a   O
conference   O
of   O
economists   O
were   O
aimed   O
at   O
those   O
who   O
say   O
that   O
Elian   O
should   O
remain   O
in   O
the   O
United   O

because   O
his   O
mother   O
sacrificed   O
his   O
life   O
to   O
take   O
her   O
to   O
``   O
freedom   O
,   O
''   O
a   O
vision   O

called   O
a   O

He   O
placed   O
the   O
blame   O
on   O
Lazaro   O
Rafael   O
Munero   O

who   O
apparently   O
organized   O
the   O
ill-   O

which   O
Elian   O

Castro   O
called   O
Munero   O
--   O
who   O
reportedly   O
drove   O
a   O
taxi   O

engaged   O
in   O

in   O
the   O
Cuban   O

The   O
adjustments   O

from   O

Columbia   O

to   O
reflect   O

Columbia   O
now   B-DATE
must   O
sell   O
the   O

accounting   O

For   O
its   O
future   O
strategy   O
,   O
Columbia   O
officials   O
said   O
the   O

branch   O
out   O
into   O
commercial   O
lending   O

managing   O

up   O

The   O

they   O

I   O

right   O
now   B-DATE

for   O
AT   O

and   O
the   O

it   O

fairly   O

as   O
you   O
might   O

well   O
imagine   O

I   O
mean   O
look   O
at   O

You   O
know   O

since   O
he   O

skyrocketed   O

,   O
Yeah   O
I   O
think   O
he's   O
doing   O
the   O
right   O
thing   O
.   O

I   O
think   O
it   O
's   O
a   O
good   O
thing   O
that   O
they   O
're   O
finally   O
going   O
to   O
be   O
downsizing   O
you   O
know   O
some   O

there   O
is   O
a   O

I   O
think   O
it   O
's   O
excellent   O
for   O
the   O

But   O
investors   O
are   O
approaching   O
the   O
changes   O
with   O
caution   O
shares   O
of   O

down   O
nearly   O

a   O

``   O
So   O
far   O
,   O
the   O
offensive   O
is   O
progressing   O
with   O
dramatic   O
success   O
,   O
''   O
said   O
a   O
buoyant   O
Gen.   O
Norman   O
Schwarzkopf   O
,   O
commander   O
of   O
U.S.   O
forces   O
.   O

Similarly   O
,   O
while   O
cautioning   O
about   O
the   O
uncertainty   O
of   O
early   O
battle   O
reports   O
,   O
White   O
House   O
spokesman   O
Marlin   O
Fitzwater   O
said   O
late   B-DATE
yesterday   I-DATE
that   O
``   O
the   O
operation   O
has   O
been   O
very   O
successful   O
.   O
''   O

Amid   O
reports   O
that   O
thousands   O
of   O
Iraqi   O
soldiers   O
had   O
surrendered   O
,   O
administration   O
aides   O
were   O
also   O
upbeat   O
in   O
private   O
,   O
with   O
one   O
even   O
talking   O
of   O
victory   O
within   O
a   O
week   O
.   O

But   O
even   O
continued   O
military   O
success   O
carries   O
political   O
and   O
diplomatic   O
risks   O
for   O
President   O
Bush   O
and   O
the   O
U.S   O
.   O

The   O
allied   O
rejection   O
of   O
the   O
last-minute   O
Soviet-led   O
diplomatic   O
effort   O
to   O
avoid   O
the   O
ground   O
war   O
enabled   O
Mr.   O
Bush   O
to   O
seize   O
the   O
initiative   O
from   O
an   O
Iraq   O
seemingly   O
bent   O
on   O
dictating   O
peace   O
terms   O
.   O

But   O
it   O
has   O
offended   O
some   O
,   O
especially   O
in   O
Arab   O
countries   O
,   O
who   O
now   O
believe   O
that   O
Mr.   O
Bush   O
's   O
real   O
objectives   O
are   O
the   O
demise   O
of   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
and   O
the   O
destruction   O
of   O
the   O
Iraqi   O
military   O
,   O
not   O
just   O
the   O
liberation   O
of   O
Kuwait   O
.   O

``   O
Why   O
have   O
a   O
war   O
?   O
''   O

asked   O
Abdul   O
Latif   O
Shekar   O
,   O
a   O
customs   O
officer   O
in   O
Egypt   O
,   O
a   O
country   O
participating   O
in   O
the   O
attack   O
on   O
Iraqi   O
troops   O
.   O

``   O
I   O
think   O
the   O
Gorbachev   O
plan   O
was   O
a   O
good   O
one   O
.   O

Iraq   O
was   O
ready   O
to   O
withdraw   O
.   O
''   O

Now   O
,   O
he   O
says   O
,   O
``   O
it   O
looks   O
like   O
the   O
West   O
just   O
wants   O
to   O
destroy   O
Iraq   O
.   O
''   O

Despite   O
the   O
early   O
indications   O
of   O
success   O
,   O
the   O
allied   O
forces   O
could   O
still   O
suffer   O
greater   O
casualties   O
and   O
become   O
bogged   O
down   O
militarily   O
,   O
especially   O
when   O
they   O
encounter   O
the   O
tough   O
Republican   O
Guard   O
,   O
which   O
is   O
entrenched   O
along   O
the   O
Iraq-   O
Kuwait   O
border   O
.   O

If   O
so   O
,   O
and   O
if   O
it   O
appears   O
that   O
the   O
American   O
goal   O
actually   O
is   O
to   O
destroy   O
the   O
Iraqi   O
regime   O
even   O
at   O
the   O
cost   O
of   O
badly   O
hurting   O
Iraqi   O
society   O
,   O
``   O
the   O
lingering   O
cost   O
of   O
that   O
could   O
be   O
high   O
,   O
''   O
worries   O
former   O
national   O
security   O
adviser   O
Zbigniew   O
Brzezinski   O
.   O

But   O
,   O
he   O
notes   O
,   O
``   O
If   O
everything   O
crumbles   O
totally   O
,   O
that   O
wo   O
n't   O
be   O
such   O
a   O
problem   O
.   O
''   O

American   O
officials   O
staunchly   O
disavow   O
any   O
interest   O
in   O
driving   O
through   O
Iraq   O
toward   O
Baghdad   O
,   O
either   O
in   O
pursuit   O
of   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
himself   O
or   O
to   O
set   O
up   O
some   O
American-controlled   O
government   O
inside   O
Iraq   O
.   O

The   O
Americans   O
say   O
their   O
battle   O
plans   O
call   O
for   O
operating   O
against   O
forces   O
inside   O
Iraq   O
as   O
far   O
north   O
as   O
the   O
city   O
of   O
Basra   O
,   O
about   O
30   O
miles   O
north   O
of   O
Kuwait   O
,   O
but   O
say   O
there   O
is   O
n't   O
any   O
plan   O
to   O
drive   O
beyond   O
that   O
.   O

Indeed   O
,   O
French   O
President   O
Francois   O
Mitterrand   O
said   O
yesterday   B-DATE
that   O
some   O
allied   O
forces   O
are   O
crossing   O
Iraqi   O
territory   O
as   O
part   O
of   O
a   O
``   O
pincer   O
''   O
movement   O
to   O
trap   O
the   O
soldiers   O
occupying   O
Kuwait   O
,   O
but   O
insisted   O
,   O
``   O
The   O
purpose   O
is   O
n't   O
to   O
invade   O
Iraqi   O
territory   O

that   O
's   O
not   O
the   O
aim   O

that   O
is   O
n't   O
the   O
mandate   O

''   O

Nevertheless   O
,   O
American   O
officials   O
over   O
the   B-DATE
weekend   I-DATE
became   O
more   O
open   O
in   O
declaring   O
that   O
by   O
destroying   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
's   O
military   O
machine   O
they   O
hope   O
to   O
destroy   O
his   O
regime   O
--   O
a   O
goal   O
likely   O
to   O
be   O
supported   O
by   O
most   O
Americans   O
.   O

In   O
a   O
pre-attack   O
message   O
,   O
Lt.   O
Gen.   O
Walter   O
Boomer   O
,   O
the   O
top   O
Marine   O
in   O
the   O
Persian   O
Gulf   O

told   O
U.S.   O
Marines   O
that   O
their   O
goal   O
is   O
to   O
``   O
restore   O

Kuwait   O

to   O
its   O
citizens   O

''   O

He   O
went   O
on   O
to   O
add   O
that   O
``   O

''   O

Secretary   O
of   O

James   O

said   O
on   O
ABC-TV   O
's   O
``   O

''   O

Of   O
course   O
,   O
it   O
is   O
still   O
far   O
too   O
early   O
to   O
assume   O
that   O
the   O
military   O
situation   O
on   O
the   O
ground   O
will   O
stay   O
as   O
smooth   O
for   O
allied   O
forces   O
as   O
it   O
appears   O
to   O
have   O
been   O
so   O
far   O
.   O

Iraq   O
still   O
has   O
the   O
potential   O
to   O
cause   O
significant   O
problems   O
by   O
using   O
forces   O
and   O
weapons   O
that   O
do   O
n't   O
yet   O
seem   O
fully   O
engaged   O
.   O

For   O
one   O
thing   O
,   O
Iraq   O
still   O
apparently   O
has   O
n't   O
unleashed   O
its   O
stockpile   O
of   O
chemical   O
weapons   O
.   O

Gen.   O
Schwarzkopf   O
said   O
that   O
some   O
early   O
reports   O
that   O
chemical   O
weapons   O
were   O
used   O
against   O
allied   O
troops   O
turned   O
out   O
to   O
be   O
``   O
bogus   O
.   O
''   O

Iraq   O
is   O
believed   O
to   O
have   O
the   O
ability   O
to   O
deliver   O
chemical   O
weapons   O
in   O
artillery   O
shells   O
or   O
,   O
perhaps   O
,   O
atop   O
Soviet-made   O
Frog7   O
missiles   O
.   O

Perhaps   O
more   O
important   O
,   O
it   O
appears   O
that   O
allied   O
troops   O
have   O
n't   O
yet   O
fully   O
engaged   O
Iraq   O
's   O
vaunted   O
Republican   O
Guard   O
,   O
which   O
has   O
been   O
sitting   O
just   O
north   O
of   O
the   O
Iraq-Kuwait   O
border   O
and   O
is   O
considered   O
the   O
most   O
potent   O
element   O
in   O
the   O
Iraqi   O
defense   O
.   O

It   O
remains   O
to   O
be   O
seen   O
how   O
much   O
damage   O
the   O
allied   O
air   O
campaign   O
was   O
able   O
to   O
inflict   O
on   O
the   O
Guard   O
,   O
and   O
whether   O
President   O
Hussein   O
will   O
commit   O
his   O
most   O
valued   O
troops   O
to   O
a   O
fight-to-the-death   O
finish   O

Certainly   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
continues   O
to   O
implore   O
his   O
country   O
to   O
fight   O
on   O
.   O

``   O
Fight   O
them   O
,   O
''   O

in   O
a   O
radio   O
address   O

``   O
All   O

everything   O

''   O

American   O
war   O
planners   O
have   O
long   O
assumed   O
that   O
the   O
early   O
stage   O
of   O
the   O
ground   O
attack   O
,   O
in   O
which   O
American   O
forces   O
would   O
use   O
their   O
speed   O
to   O
sweep   O
around   O
Iraqi   O
defenses   O
and   O
their   O
strength   O
to   O
punch   O
through   O
the   O
relatively   O
weak   O
Iraqi   O
front   O
line   O
,   O
would   O
be   O
the   O
easiest   O
part   O
.   O

Despite   O
these   O
early   O
successes   O
,   O
the   O
mere   O
fact   O
that   O
a   O
ground   O
campaign   O
has   O
begun   O
almost   O
guarantees   O
that   O
the   O
Bush   O
administration   O
will   O
face   O
fresh   O
problems   O
growing   O
out   O
of   O
the   O
military   O
situation   O
.   O

There   O
are   O
likely   O
to   O
be   O
additional   O
American   O
prisoners   O
of   O
war   O
taken   O
,   O
and   O
there   O
are   O
signs   O
that   O
President   O
Hussein   O
is   O
taking   O
Kuwaiti   O
hostages   O

U.S.   O
and   O

City   O
are   O
being   O
rounded   O
up   O
and   O
held   O
by   O
Iraqi   O
troops   O
,   O
apparently   O
either   O
for   O
use   O
as   O
human   O
shields   O
or   O
for   O
use   O
later   O
in   O
bargaining   O
once   O
the   O
war   O
is   O
over   O
.   O

President   O
Bush   O
's   O
political   O
argument   O
for   O
going   O
to   O
a   O
ground   O
war   O
has   O
been   O
strengthened   O
by   O
the   O
growing   O
stream   O
of   O
reports   O
of   O
wanton   O
Iraqi   O
destruction   O
inside   O
Kuwait   O
.   O

U.S.   O
officials   O
say   O
that   O
hundreds   O
of   O
Kuwaiti   O
oil   O
wells   O
now   O
may   O
have   O
been   O
set   O
afire   O
.   O

And   O
Robert   O
Gates   O
,   O
Mr.   O
Bush   O
's   O
deputy   O
national   O
security   O
adviser   O
,   O
asserted   O
in   O
an   O
interview   O
on   O
the   O
Cable   O
News   O
Network   O
that   O
Iraqi   O
troops   O
have   O
set   O
fire   O
to   O
``   O
large   O
sections   O
''   O
of   O
Kuwait   O
City   O
.   O

Mr.   O
Bush   O
and   O
his   O
aides   O
were   O
leaning   O
toward   O
a   O
military   O
conclusion   O
of   O
the   O
crisis   O
even   O
before   O
the   O
latest   O
reports   O
of   O
Iraqi   O
atrocities   O
in   O
Kuwait   O
came   O
to   O
light   O
.   O

The   O
president   O
and   O
his   O
top   O
aides   O
tentatively   O
decided   O
on   O
Feb   O
.   O

11   O
that   O
a   O
ground   O
war   O
would   O
be   O
necessary   O
.   O

The   O
decision   O
was   O
made   O
after   O
Defense   O
Secretary   O
Dick   O
Cheney   O
and   O
Gen.   O
Colin   O
Powell   O
,   O
chairman   O
of   O
the   O
Joint   O
Chiefs   O
of   O
Staff   O
,   O
returned   O
from   O
a   O
visit   O
with   O
military   O
commanders   O
in   O
Saudi   O
Arabia   O
,   O
administration   O
officials   O
say   O
.   O

Then   O
,   O
a   B-DATE
week   I-DATE
or   I-DATE
so   I-DATE
ago   I-DATE
,   O
Gen.   O
Schwarzkopf   O
secretly   O
picked   O
Saturday   B-TIME
night   I-TIME
as   O
the   O
optimal   O
time   O
to   O
start   O
the   O
offensive   O
.   O

The   O
date   O
was   O
unaffected   O
by   O
the   O
last-ditch   O
Soviet   O
peace   O
initiative   O
.   O

The   O
real   O
problem   O
with   O
the   O
Soviet   O
proposals   O
,   O
U.S.   O
officials   O
now   O
say   O
,   O
was   O
that   O
they   O
all   O
would   O
have   O
required   O
lifting   O
economic   O
sanctions   O
against   O
Iraq   O
.   O

The   O
Bush   O
administration   O
considers   O
the   O
sanctions   O
essential   O
to   O
keeping   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
under   O
control   O
should   O
he   O
survive   O
the   O
war   O
.   O

Mr.   O
Bush   O
forestalled   O
further   O
diplomatic   O
maneuvering   O
by   O
issuing   O
an   O
ultimatum   O
on   O
behalf   O
of   O
the   O
allies   O
demanding   O
that   O
Iraq   O
withdraw   O
within   O
a   B-DURATION
week   I-DURATION
,   O
starting   O
at   O
noon   B-TIME
Saturday   I-TIME
.   O

Administration   O
aides   O
said   O
that   O
the   O
idea   O
of   O
the   O
ultimatum   O
was   O
Gen.   O
Powell   O
's   O
.   O

He   O
argued   O
setting   O
an   O
explicit   O
deadline   O
for   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
to   O
break   O
would   O
,   O
when   O
it   O
was   O
broken   O
,   O
give   O
the   O
U.S.   O
military   O
a   O
clear   O
green   O
light   O
to   O
proceed   O
.   O

In   O
setting   O
out   O
his   O
final   O
challenge   O
to   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
,   O
Mr.   O
Bush   O
continued   O
the   O
intensive   O
personal   O
diplomacy   O
he   O
began   O
after   O
the   O
invasion   O
last   B-DATE
August   I-DATE
.   O

After   O
cabling   O
world   O
leaders   O
about   O
his   O
intention   O
to   O
give   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
a   O
final   O
deadline   O
to   O
exit   O
Kuwait   O
,   O
he   O
offered   O
him   O
a   B-DURATION
week   I-DURATION
to   O
withdraw   O
fully   O
,   O
instead   O
of   O
the   B-DURATION
four   I-DURATION
days   I-DURATION
he   O
originally   O
considered   O
,   O
because   O
of   O
objections   O
from   O
some   O
European   O
partners   O
that   O
four   O
days   O
seemed   O
punitive   O
and   O
unrealistic   O
.   O

And   O
when   O
he   O
and   O
President   O
Gorbachev   O
spoke   O
about   O
the   O
decision   O
in   O
a   O
talk   O
lasting   O
nearly   B-DURATION
an   I-DURATION
hour   I-DURATION
,   O
the   O
President   O
took   O
pains   O
to   O
listen   O
to   O
what   O
his   O
counterpart   O
had   O
to   O
say   O
,   O
although   O
he   O
already   O
had   O
decided   O
that   O
the   O
Soviet   O
alternative   O
to   O
the   O
allied   O
deadline   O
was   O
unacceptable   O
.   O

Finally   O
,   O
when   O
Iraq   O
failed   O
to   O
respond   O
to   O
the   O
U.S.   O
ultimatum   O
,   O
Mr.   O
Bush   O
let   O
the   O
ground   O
offensive   O
begin   O
as   O
previously   O
planned   O
Saturday   B-TIME
night   I-TIME
.   O

The   O
attack   O
was   O
lightning   O
quick   O
,   O
as   O
allied   O
forces   O
punched   O
through   O
tall   O
sand   O
berms   O
on   O
the   O
border   O
and   O
pushed   O
forward   O
into   O
Iraq   O
and   O
Kuwait   O
.   O

U.S.   O
Marines   O
were   O
said   O
to   O
have   O
breached   O
troublesome   O
mine   O
fields   O
along   O
the   O
Iraqi   O
lines   O
but   O
Pentagon   O
officials   O
said   O
no   O
amphibious   O
assault   O
on   O
Kuwait's   O
beaches   O
had   O
begun   O
.   O

Long   O
columns   O
of   O
Iraqi   O
prisoners   O
of   O
war   O
could   O
be   O
seen   O
trudging   O
through   O
the   O
desert   O
toward   O
the   O
allied   O
rear   O
.   O

U.S.   O
commanders   O
said   O
5,500   O
Iraqi   O
prisoners   O
were   O
taken   O
in   O
the   B-DURATION
first   I-DURATION
hours   I-DURATION
of   O
the   O
ground   O
war   O
,   O
though   O
some   O
military   O
officials   O
later   O
said   O
the   O
total   O
may   O
have   O
climbed   O
above   O
8,000   O
.   O

The   O
U.S.   O
hopes   O
its   O
troops   O
will   O
drive   O
Iraqi   O
forces   O
out   O
of   O
Kuwait   O
quickly   O
,   O
leaving   O
much   O
of   O
Iraq   O
's   O
offensive   O
military   O
equipment   O
destroyed   O
or   O
abandoned   O
in   O
Kuwait   O
.   O

It   O
expects   O
that   O
tens   O
of   O
thousands   O
of   O
Iraqi   O
soldiers   O
will   O
surrender   O
to   O
the   O
U.S.   O
and   O
its   O
allies   O
over   O
the   B-DURATION
next   I-DURATION
few   I-DURATION
days   I-DURATION
.   O

If   O
the   O
allies   O
succeed   O
,   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
will   O
have   O
plunged   O
his   O
country   O
first   O
into   O
a   O
fruitless   O
eight-   B-DURATION
year   I-DURATION
war   O
against   O
Iran   O
and   O
then   O
into   O
a   O
humiliating   O
war   O
against   O
the   O
U.S.   O
and   O
the   O
allies   O
to   O
defend   O
his   O
conquest   O
of   O
Kuwait   O
,   O
leaving   O
much   O
of   O
his   O
country   O
's   O
military   O
establishment   O
and   O
modern   O
infrastructure   O
in   O
ruins   O
.   O

Meanwhile   O
,   O
the   O
U.S.   O
hopes   O
,   O
economic   O
sanctions   O
and   O
an   O
international   O
arms   O
embargo   O
will   O
remain   O
in   O
effect   O
until   O
Iraq   O
pays   O
war   O
reparations   O
to   O
Kuwait   O
to   O
cover   O
war   O
damages   O
.   O

That   O
would   O
undermine   O
any   O
chances   O
of   O
rebuilding   O
either   O
Iraq   O
or   O
its   O
armed   O
forces   O
in   O
short   O
order   O
as   O
long   O
as   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
remains   O
in   O
power   O
.   O

The   O
American   O
hope   O
is   O
that   O
someone   O
from   O
within   O
Iraq   O
,   O
perhaps   O
from   O
the   O
army's   O
professional   O
ranks   O
,   O
will   O
step   O
forward   O
and   O
push   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
aside   O
so   O
that   O
the   O
country   O
can   O
begin   O
recovering   O
from   O
the   O
disaster   O
.   O

Outside   O
analysts   O
think   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
's   O
position   O
is   O
indeed   O
precarious   O
.   O

``   O
I   O
think   O
frankly   O
Saddam   O
is   O
finished   O
,   O
no   O
matter   O
what   O
happens   O
,   O
''   O
says   O
Christine   O
Helms   O
,   O
a   O
Middle   O
East   O
scholar   O
who   O
has   O
written   O
extensively   O
about   O
Iraq   O
.   O

``   O
These   O
guys   O
simply   O
do   O
n't   O
retire   O
to   O
condos   O
over   O
the   O
Euphrates   O
.   O
''   O

Despite   O
the   O
lack   O
of   O
any   O
obvious   O
successors   O
,   O
the   O
Iraqi   O
leader   O
's   O
internal   O
power   O
base   O
appeared   O
to   O
be   O
narrowing   O
even   O
before   O
the   O
war   O
began   O
.   O

Some   O
analysts   O
say   O
he   O
appeared   O
to   O
be   O
relying   O
on   O
a   O
smaller   O
and   O
smaller   O
circle   O
of   O
close   O
advisers   O
and   O
relatives   O
.   O

If   O
that   O
's   O
true   O
,   O
the   O
narrowing   O
of   O
his   O
support   O
would   O
make   O
it   O
easier   O
for   O
someone   O
to   O
push   O
him   O
aside   O
from   O
within   O
.   O

Yet   O
,   O
paradoxically   O
,   O
the   O
perception   O
that   O
the   O
U.S.   O
wants   O
to   O
destroy   O
Iraq   O
may   O
increase   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
's   O
support   O
within   O
the   O
Iraqi   O
military   O
.   O

And   O
the   O
U.S.   O
now   O
will   O
face   O
sharper   O
questions   O
in   O
the   O
Arab   O
world   O
since   O
it   O
didn't   O
back   O
the   O
peace   O
proposals   O
worked   O
out   O
in   O
Moscow   O
.   O

``   O
We   O
looked   O
to   O
the   O
United   O
States   O
,   O
we   O
expected   O
you   O
to   O
have   O
the   O
moral   O

He   O
attributed   O
the   O

The   O
terms   O

he   O
would   O
never   O

his   O

.   O

Over   O
the   B-DURATION
weekend   I-DURATION
,   O
lawyers   O
for   O
the   O
family   O
raised   O
accusations   O
that   O
Juan   O
Miguel   O
Gonzalez   O
had   O
mistreated   O
his   O
son   O
in   O
telephone   O
conversations   O
,   O
saying   O
he   O
had   O
told   O
the   O
boy   O
that   O
his   O
mother   O
was   O
alive   O
and   O
waiting   O
for   O
him   O
in   O
Cuba   O

But   O
by   O
Monday   B-DATE
,   O
federal   O
officials   O
hardened   O
their   O
negotiating   O
stance   O
,   O
insisting   O
the   O
boy   O
would   O
be   O
turned   O
over   O

Moves   O
to   O
keep   O
Elian   O
in   O
this   O
country   O

federal   O
legislation   O
appear   O
to   O
be   O
stymied   O
,   O
as   O
most   O
lawmakers   O
seem   O
to   O
agree   O
the   O
boy   O
should   O
go   O
back   O
to   O
Cuba   O

that   O
6   O

in   O

his   O
part   O

Fidel   O

the   O
ultimate   O
political   O
survivor   O

People   O
have   O
predicted   O
his   O
demise   O
so   O
many   O
times   O

and   O
the   O

it   O

again   O

clearly   O
an   O
opportunity   O

It   O
will   O
give   O
the   O
rest   O
of   O
the   O

the   O
view   O
that   O
Cuba   O
is   O
like   O

nation   O

something   O
the   O
US   O

of   O
course   O

nearly   B-DURATION
forty   I-DURATION

it   O
would   O
not   O
tolerate   O
totalitarian   O
rule   O

its   O
own   O
backyard   O

It   O
is   O
the   O
US   O
economic   O
and   O
political   O
embargo   O
which   O
has   O
kept   O
Cuba   O
in   O
a   O
box   O
.   O

The   O
main   O
positive   O
for   O
Castro   O
to   O
invite   O
the   O
Pope   O
is   O
international   O
,   O
to   O
be   O
able   O
to   O
say   O
to   O
the   O
rest   O
of   O
the   O
world   O
,   O
this   O
government   O
is   O
not   O
as   O
closed   O
,   O
as   O
intolerant   O
,   O
uh   O
as   O
totalitarian   O
as   O
some   O
make   O
it   O
out   O
to   O
be   O
.   O

One   O
of   O
the   O
scenarios   O
widely   O
advanced   O
before   O
the   O
visit   O
is   O
that   O
through   O
the   O
Pope   O
,   O
Cuba   O
,   O
still   O
led   O
by   O
Castro   O
,   O
can   O
begin   O
a   O
more   O
productive   O
relationship   O
with   O
the   O
world   O
.   O

That   O
will   O
,   O
in   O
turn   O
,   O
bring   O
pressure   O
on   O
Washington   O
to   O
change   O
.   O

Those   O
observers   O
looking   O
for   O
a   O
battle   O
between   O
uncompromising   O
representatives   O
and   O
very   O
different   O
ideologies   O
will   O
,   O
in   O
all   O
likelihood   O
,   O
be   O
disappointed   O
.   O

Castro   O
has   O
said   O
that   O
you   O
can   O
be   O
a   O
Communist   O
and   O
still   O
be   O
a   O
Christian   O
.   O

He   O
says   O
he   O
and   O
the   O
Pope   O
both   O
want   O
to   O
end   O
the   O
exploitation   O
of   O
man   O
by   O
man   O
.   O

The   O
question   O
is   O
who   O
will   O
Cubans   O
believe   O
?   O

The   O
main   O
negative   O
is   O
the   O
risk   O
that   O
the   O
Pope   O
's   O
visit   O
will   O
persuade   O
a   O
great   O
many   O
more   O
Cubans   O
to   O
break   O
loose   O
of   O
the   O
Cuban   O
government   O
.   O

If   O
so   O
,   O
then   O
the   O
Pope   O
's   O
visit   O
would   O
really   O
open   O
up   O
a   O
new   O
chapter   O
in   O
the   O
government   O
's   O
relations   O
with   O
its   O
own   O
society   O
.   O

For   O
the   O
Cuban   O
government   O
,   O
that   O
is   O
the   O
risk   O

other   O
segments   O
of   O
the   O
stock   O
market   O
.   O

Because   O
of   O
program   O
trading   O
it   O
is   O
more   O
difficult   O
to   O
trade   O
many   O
OTC   O
stocks   O
without   O
sharp   O
price   O
moves   O
,   O
a   O
condition   O
known   O
as   O
illiquidity   O
.   O

Moreover   O
,   O
the   O
price   O
volatility   O
that   O
is   O
amplified   O
by   O
program   O
trading   O
is   O
undercutting   O
efforts   O
to   O
woo   O
individual   O
investors   O
back   O
to   O
an   O
OTC   O
market   O
that   O
sorely   O
misses   O
them   O
.   O

Some   O
of   O
these   O
problems   O
are   O
neither   O
new   O
nor   O
unique   O
to   O
the   O

But   O
the   O

often   O
tumultuous   O

in   O

Shearson   O
Lehman   O
Hutton   O
,   O
acknowledges   O
that   O
he   O
was   O
n't   O
troubled   O
by   O
program   O
trading   O
when   O
it   O
began   O
in   O
the   O
pre-crash   O
bull   O
market   O
because   O
it   O
added   O
liquidity   O
and   O
people   O
were   O
pleased   O
to   O
see   O
stock   O

rising   O

``   O

''   O
says   O
Mr.   O

now   B-DATE
thinks   O
it   O
adds   O
unnecessary   O

Of   O

,   O
there   O
were   O

programs   O
in   O
past   B-DATE
years   I-DATE
,   O
too   O
,   O
but   O
they   O
seem   O
to   O
hurt   O
market   O
makers   O
more   O
painfully   O
these   B-DATE
days   I-DATE
.   O

That   O
's   O
largely   O
because   O
of   O
defensive   O
measures   O
they   O
adopted   O
after   O
the   O
1987   B-DATE
crash   O
,   O
when   O
individual   O
investors   O
fled   O
the   O
market   O
and   O
trading   O
activity   O
dwindled   O
.   O

Market   O
makers   O
,   O
to   O
cut   O
costs   O
,   O
slashed   O
inventories   O
of   O
stocks   O
they   O
keep   O
on   O
hand   O
to   O
sell   O
investors   O
when   O
other   O
holders   O
are   O
n't   O
selling   O
.   O

And   O
to   O
protect   O
their   O
reduced   O
capital   O
investment   O
from   O
eroding   O
further   O
,   O
market   O
makers   O
became   O
quicker   O
to   O
lower   O
price   O
quotes   O
when   O
sell   O
programs   O
are   O
in   O
progress   O
.   O

On   O
days   O
when   O
prices   O
are   O
tumbling   O
,   O
they   O
must   O
be   O
willing   O
to   O
buy   O
shares   O
from   O
sellers   O
when   O
no   O
one   O
else   O
will   O
.   O

In   O
such   O
an   O
environment   O
,   O
market   O
makers   O
can   O
suffer   O
huge   O
losses   O
both   O
on   O
trades   O
made   O
that   O
day   O
at   O
steadily   O
dropping   O
prices   O
and   O
in   O

The   O
main   O
reason   O

this   O

that   O

According   O
to   O
individuals   O
familiar   O
with   O
Mr.   O

's   O
case   O
,   O
prosecutors   O
issued   O
their   O
warning   O
this   B-DATE
week   I-DATE
after   O
one   O
of   O
Mr.   O
Antar   O
's   O
attorneys   O
asked   O
whether   O
legal   O

In   O
a   O
letter   O
,   O
prosecutors   O
told   O
Mr.   O

's   O
lawyers   O
that   O
because   O
of   O
the   O
recent   B-DATE
Supreme   O
Court   O
rulings   O
,   O
they   O
could   O
expect   O
that   O
any   O
fees   O
collected   O
from   O
Mr.   O
Antar   O
may   O
be   O
seized   O
.   O

Prosecutors   O
have   O
told   O
Mr.   O
Antar   O
's   O
attorneys   O
that   O
they   O
believe   O
Mr.   O
Antar's   O
allegedly   O
ill-gotten   O
gains   O
are   O
so   O
great   O
that   O
any   O
money   O
he   O
has   O
used   O
to   O
pay   O
attorneys   O
derives   O
from   O
illegal   O
activities   O
.   O

Therefore   O
,   O
they   O
said   O
,   O
the   O
money   O
can   O
be   O
taken   O
from   O
the   O

even   O

In   O
Newark   O
,   O
U.S.   O
Attorney   O
Samuel   O

said   O
,   O
``   O
I   O

Mr.   O

said   O
his   O

Mr.   O
Antar   O
was   O
charged   O
last   B-DATE

in   O
a   O
civil   O

filed   O
in   O

court   O
in   O
Newark   O
by   O
the   O
Securities   O
and   O
Exchange   O
Commission   O
.   O

In   O
that   O
suit   O
,   O
the   O
SEC   O
accused   O
Mr.   O
Antar   O
of   O
engaging   O
in   O
a   O
``   O
massive   O
financial   O
fraud   O

overstate   O
the   O

Through   O
his   O
lawyers   O
,   O
Mr.   O
Antar   O
has   O
denied   O
allegations   O
in   O
the   O
SEC   O
suit   O
and   O
in   O
civil   O
suits   O
previously   O
filed   O
by   O
shareholders   O
against   O
Mr.   O
Antar   O
and   O
others   O
.   O

The   O
SEC   O
has   O
alleged   O
that   O
Mr.   O
Antar   O
aimed   O
to   O
pump   O
up   O
the   O
company   O
's   O
stock   O

through   O
false   O

reap   O
huge   O
profits   O
.   O

Mr.   O
Antar   O
,   O
the   O
SEC   O
said   O
,   O
made   O
more   O
than   O
$   O
60   O
million   O
from   O
the   O
sale   O
of   O
his   O
shares   O
between   O
1985   B-DATE
and   O
1987   B-DATE
.   O

The   O
Justice   O
Department   O
has   O
emphasized   O
that   O
the   O
government   O
's   O
fee-forfeiture   O
power   O
is   O
to   O
be   O
used   O
sparingly   O
.   O

According   O
to   O
department   O
policy   O
,   O
prosecutors   O
must   O
make   O
a   O
strong   O
showing   O
that   O
lawyers   O
'   O
fees   O
came   O
from   O
assets   O
tainted   O
by   O
illegal   O
profits   O
before   O
any   O
attempts   O
at   O
seizure   O
are   O
made   O
.   O

Still   O
,   O
criminal   O
defense   O
lawyers   O
worry   O
that   O
defendants   O
are   O
being   O
deprived   O
of   O
their   O
Sixth   O
Amendment   O

the   O

can   O
seize   O

fees   O
.   O

They   O
also   O
worry   O
that   O
if   O
the   O
government   O
applies   O
asset-forfeiture   O
laws   O
broadly   O
,   O
the   O
best   O
defense   O

will   O
be   O
unwilling   O

take   O

Upjohn   O
Co.   O
said   O
it   O
will   O
offer   O
an   O
early   O
retirement   O
package   O
to   O
as   O
many   O
as   O
1,100   O

in   O
a   O

move   O
expected   O
to   O
result   O
in   O
a   O
fourth-quarter   B-DURATION
charge   O
.   O

Upjohn   O
officials   O
said   O
they   O
could   O
n't   O
estimate   O
the   O
size   O
of   O
the   O
charge   O
until   O
they   O
determine   O
which   O

how   O

will   O
participate   O
in   O
the   O
retirement   O
plan   O
.   O

But   O
the   O
pharmaceutical   O
company   O
said   O
it   O
``   O
anticipates   O
the   O
long-term   O
savings   O

The   O

,   O
available   O
to   O
Upjohn   O
employees   O
55   O
years   O
old   O

older   O

could   O

10   O
%   O

20   O

Chairman   O
Theodore   O

called   O
the   O

two-year   B-DURATION
strategy   O
to   O

``   O
an   O

''   O

But   O
some   O
analysts   O
questioned   O
how   O
much   O
of   O
an   O
impact   O
the   O
retirement   O
package   O
will   O
have   O
,   O
because   O
few   O
jobs   O
will   O
end   O
up   O
being   O
eliminated   O
.   O

``   O
It   O
's   O
a   O
cosmetic   O

Jonathan   O
S.   O
Gelles   O
of   O
Wertheim   O
Schroder   O

According   O
to   O
Upjohn   O
's   O
estimates   O
,   O
only   O
50   O
%   O
to   O
60   O
%   O
of   O
the   O
1,100   O
eligible   O
employees   O
will   O
take   O
advantage   O
of   O
the   O
plan   O
.   O

Upjohn   O
further   O
estimated   O
that   O
about   O
50   O
%   O
of   O
the   O
employees   O
who   O
leave   O
for   O
early   O
retirement   O
may   O
be   O
replaced   O
.   O

As   O
a   O
result   O
,   O
Upjohn   O
will   O
likely   O
trim   O
only   O
about   O
275   O

he   O

``   O
heard   O
nothing   O

to   O

the   O

April   I-DATE

:   O
The   O
Supreme   O
Court   O
took   O
a   O
detour   O
this   B-DATE
week   I-DATE
from   O
the   O
core   O
principle   O
of   O
gender   O
fairness   O
it   O
vindicated   O
two   B-DATE
years   I-DATE
ago   I-DATE
in   O
its   O
ruling   O
invalidating   O
the   O
use   O
of   O

to   O
justify   O
denying   O
women   O
admission   O
to   O
the   O
Virginia   O
Military   O
Institute   O
.   O

By   O
a   O
6-3   O
vote   O
,   O
the   O
court   O
upheld   O
a   O
discriminatory   O
immigration   O
law   O
that   O
gives   O
a   O
child   O
born   O
overseas   O
to   O
an   O
unmarried   O
American   O
woman   O
a   O
better   O
chance   O
at   O
citizenship   O
than   O
a   O
child   O
born   O
to   O
an   O
unmarried   O
American   O
man   O
.   O

Under   O
the   O
statute   O
,   O
a   O
child   O
born   O
abroad   O
to   O
an   O
unwed   O
American   O
mother   O
is   O
automatically   O
considered   O
a   O
U.S.   O
citizen   O
.   O

But   O
the   O
child   O
of   O
an   O
unwed   O
American   O
father   O
has   O
no   O
citizenship   O
rights   O
unless   O
the   O
father   O
takes   O
the   O
affirmative   O
step   O
of   O
acknowledging   O
paternity   O
and   O
formally   O
agrees   O
to   O
provide   O
support   O
until   O
the   O
child   O
turns   O
18   O
.   O

The   O
majority   O
's   O
views   O
were   O
expressed   O
in   O
three   O
separate   O
opinions   O
,   O
the   O
most   O
disquieting   O
of   O
which   O
was   O
written   O
by   O
a   O
liberal   O
member   O
,   O
Justice   O
John   O
Paul   O
Stevens   O
,   O
and   O
joined   O
by   O
a   O
conservative   O
,   O
Chief   O
Justice   O
William   O
Rehnquist   O
.   O

The   O
opinion   O
,   O
which   O
found   O
the   O
gender   O
distinction   O
reasonable   O
,   O
relied   O
heavily   O
on   O
outmoded   O
generalities   O
about   O
family   O
roles   O
,   O
including   O
the   O
flawed   O
presumption   O
that   O
mothers   O
have   O
a   O
closer   O
relationship   O
to   O
their   O
children   O
than   O
fathers   O
do   O
.   O

As   O
Justice   O
Stephen   O
Breyer   O
asked   O
in   O
a   O
strong   O
dissent   O
,   O
``   O
what   O
sense   O

it   O
make   O
''   O
to   O
apply   O
citizenship   O
barriers   O
``   O
only   O

where   O
paternity   O

readily   O
be   O

and   O
where   O
women   O

men   O
both   O
are   O
likely   O
to   O

a   O

?   O
''   O
.   O

Justices   O
Sandra   O
Day   O
O'Connor   O
and   O
Anthony   O
Kennedy   O
seemed   O
to   O
agree   O
that   O
the   O
law   O
amounted   O
to   O
unconstitutional   O
sex   O
discrimination   O
.   O

Butinstead   O
of   O
providing   O
the   O
votes   O
to   O
strike   O
it   O
down   O
,   O
they   O
chose   O
to   O
uphold   O
it   O
on   O
the   O
flimsy   O
ground   O
that   O
because   O
the   O
sex   O
of   O
the   O
parent   O
and   O
not   O
the   O
child   O
made   O
the   O
difference   O
under   O
the   O
law   O
,   O
the   O
plaintiff   O
did   O
not   O
have   O
standing   O
to   O
bring   O
the   O
case   O
.   O

The   O
Justice   O
Department   O
,   O
which   O
supported   O
the   O
statute   O
,   O
did   O
not   O
cover   O
itself   O
with   O
glory   O
either   O
.   O

The   O
department   O
retreated   O
from   O
its   O
position   O
in   O
the   O
VMI   O
case   O
when   O
it   O
argued   O
that   O
the   O
government   O
could   O
not   O
make   O
policy   O
based   O
on   O
stereotypes   O

for   O
the   O
court   O

it   O
managed   O
with   O
its   O
splintered   O
ruling   O

cast   O
doubt   O
both   O
on   O
the   O
constitutionality   O
of   O
the   O

and   O
the   O
relatives   O
were   O
treating   O
the   O
raid   O
to   O
return   O
Elian   O
as   O
though   O
it   O
were   O
a   O
Nazi   O
SS   O
operation   O
.   O

Yet   O
federal   O
agents   O
had   O
a   O
warrant   O
,   O
were   O
enforcing   O
US   O
law   O
,   O
and   O
entered   O
the   O
house   O
with   O
the   O
proper   O
force   O
to   O
ensure   O
minimal   O
resistance   O
and   O
injury   O
.   O

It   O
was   O
a   O
model   O
of   O
efficient   O
law   O
enforcement   O
,   O
guided   O
by   O
due   O
process   O
.   O

The   O
raid   O
was   O
necessary   O
because   O
the   O
Gonzalez   O
relatives   O
in   O
Miami   O
,   O
refusing   O
to   O
return   O
the   O
boy   O
,   O
made   O
him   O
into   O
a   O
symbol   O
of   O
resistance   O
to   O
Fidel   O
Castro   O
.   O

Elian   O
printed   O
his   O
name   O
on   O
an   O
application   O
for   O
asylum   O
and   O
was   O
put   O
in   O
front   O
of   O
a   O
video   O
camera   O
to   O
say   O
that   O
he   O
did   O
not   O
want   O
to   O
go   O
back   O
to   O
Cuba   O
.   O

The   O
relatives   O
treated   O
the   O
boy   O
like   O
a   O
political   O
prop   O
.   O

As   O
did   O
Castro   O
,   O
a   O
master   O
manipulator   O
of   O
public   O
opinion   O
in   O
Cuba   O
.   O

Had   O
the   O
relatives   O
allowed   O
Elian   O
to   O
return   O
to   O
Cuba   O
,   O
they   O
would   O
have   O
denied   O
the   O
dictator   O
an   O
opportunity   O
to   O
reenergize   O
support   O
for   O
his   O
regime   O
.   O

Juan   O
Miguel   O
Gonzalez   O
apparently   O
is   O
a   O
Castro   O
supporter   O
,   O
but   O
that   O
should   O
not   O
disqualify   O
him   O
from   O
being   O
reunited   O
with   O
his   O
child   O
.   O

Ever   O
since   O
he   O
first   O
learned   O
that   O
Elian   O
was   O
in   O
Florida   O
last   B-DATE
November   I-DATE
,   O
he   O
has   O
been   O
persistent   O
in   O
seeking   O
the   O
boy   O
's   O
return   O
.   O

Elian   O
has   O
developed   O
great   O
affection   O
for   O
the   O
Miami   O
relatives   O
.   O

It   O
would   O
be   O
ideal   O
if   O
they   O
could   O
have   O
returned   O
him   O
to   O
his   O
father   O
yet   O
stayed   O
in   O
contact   O
while   O
their   O
appeal   O
was   O
pending   O
in   O
court   O
.   O

Negotiations   O
failed   O
,   O
however   O
,   O
because   O
they   O
insisted   O
on   O
taking   O
the   O
place   O
of   O
the   O
father   O
,   O
rather   O
than   O
being   O
treated   O
as   O
concerned   O
,   O
yet   O
distant   O
,   O
relatives   O
.   O

Juan   O
and   O
Elian   O
Gonzalez   O
will   O
remain   O
in   O
the   O
United   O
States   O
pending   O
the   O
appeal   O
.   O

The   O
father   O
can   O
remain   O
here   O
,   O
but   O
he   O
can   O
also   O
return   O
to   O
Cuba   O
if   O
he   O
wishes   O
.   O

Like   O
any   O
other   O
6-year-old   O
in   O
the   O
care   O
of   O
a   O
loving   O
parent   O
,   O
Elian   O
should   O
go   O
wherever   O
that   O
parent   O
wants   O
.   O

The   O
unusual   O
airing   O
of   O

against   O
President   O

appeared   O
aimed   O

If   O
the   O
heavy   O

Such   O
selling   O
could   O
erode   O
prices   O
of   O

already   O
weakened   O

Although   O

is   O
,   O
all   O
of   O
the   O
attention   O
so   O
far   O
has   O
fallen   O
on   O
James   O
C.   O
Kopp   O
,   O
a   O
44-year-old   O
anti-abortion   O
protester   O
who   O
had   O
been   O

witness   O
''   O
in   O
the   O
case   O

Clark   O
said   O
it   O
was   O
easier   O
to   O
seek   O
extradition   O
of   O
an   O
indicted   O
suspect   O
from   O
another   O

For   O
now   O
,   O
though   O

that   O
would   O

advantage   O

admitted   O

no   O

where   O

is   O

Clark   O
said   O
there   O
was   O
``   O
no   O
question   O
''   O
that   O
the   O
finding   O
of   O
the   O
rifle   O
was   O
important   O
in   O
his   O
decision   O
to   O
seek   O
an   O
indictment   O

at   O
the   O
FBI   O
laboratory   O
in   O
Washington   O
,   O
but   O
the   O
authorities   O
have   O
said   O
it   O
resembles   O
the   O
kind   O
of   O
high-powered   O
rifle   O
used   O
in   O
the   O
slaying   O

Clark   O
said   O
other   O
evidence   O
that   O
prosecutors   O
might   O

again   O

500   O

The   O
company   O
also   O
took   O
a   O
write-off   O
of   O
$   O
150   O
million   O
to   O
cover   O
losses   O
on   O
some   O

look   O
at   O

In   O
addition   O
,   O
Unisys   O
set   O
up   O
an   O
unspecified   O
reserve   O
--   O
apparently   O
$   O
60   O
million   O
to   O
$   O
70   O

to   O
cover   O
the   O
minimum   O
amount   O
it   O
will   O
have   O
to   O
pay   O
the   O
government   O
because   O
of   O
its   O
involvement   O

the   O
defense-procurement   O
scandal   O
.   O

Unisys   O
also   O
noted   O
that   O
it   O
paid   O
$   O
78.8   O
million   O
in   O
taxes   O
during   O
the   B-DATE
quarter   I-DATE
,   O
even   O
though   O
tax   O
payments   O
normally   O
would   O
be   O

in   O
a   O
quarter   O
that   O
produced   O
such   O
a   O
big   O
loss   O
.   O

The   O
tax   O
payments   O
will   O
leave   O
Unisys   O
with   O
$   O
225   O
million   O

that   O

in   O

In   O
addition   O
,   O
Unisys   O
said   O
it   O
reduced   O
computer   O
inventories   O
a   O
further   O
$   O
100   O
million   O
during   O
the   B-DATE

leaving   O
it   O
within   O
$   O

Still   O
,   O
Unisys   O
said   O
its   O
European   O
business   O
was   O
weak   O
during   O
the   B-DATE
quarter   I-DATE
,   O
a   O
worrisome   O
sign   O
given   O
that   O
the   O
company   O
has   O
relied   O
on   O
solid   O
results   O
overseas   O
to   O
overcome   O
weakness   O
in   O
the   O
U.S.   O
over   O
the   B-DATE
past   I-DATE
several   I-DATE
quarters   I-DATE
.   O

The   O
company   O
also   O
reported   O
slower   O
growth   O
in   O
another   O
important   O
business   O
:   O
systems   O
that   O
use   O
the   O
Unix   O
operating   O
system   O
.   O

That   O
would   O
be   O
a   O
huge   O
problem   O
if   O
it   O
were   O
to   O
continue   O
,   O
because   O
Unisys   O
is   O
betting   O
its   O
business   O
on   O
the   O
assumption   O
that   O
customers   O
want   O
to   O
move   O
away   O
from   O
using   O
operating   O
systems   O
that   O
run   O
on   O
only   O
one   O
manufacturer   O
's   O
equipment   O
and   O
toward   O
systems   O
--   O
mainly   O
Unix   O
--   O
that   O
work   O
on   O
almost   O
anyone   O
's   O
machines   O
.   O

In   O
addition   O
,   O
Unisys   O
must   O
deal   O
with   O
its   O
increasingly   O
oppressive   O
debt   O
load   O
.   O

Debt   O
has   O
risen   O
to   O
around   O
$   O
4   O
billion   O
,   O
or   O
about   O
50   O
%   O
of   O
total   O
capitalization   O
.   O

That   O
means   O
Unisys   O
must   O
pay   O
about   O
$   O
100   O
million   O
in   O
interest   O
every   B-SET
quarter   I-SET
,   O
on   O
top   O
of   O
$   O
27   O
million   O
in   O
dividends   O
on   O
preferred   O
stock   O
.   O

Jim   O
Unruh   O
,   O
Unisys   O
's   O
president   O
,   O
said   O
he   O
is   O
approaching   O
next   O
year   O
with   O
caution   O
.   O

He   O
said   O
the   O
strength   O
of   O
the   O
world-wide   O
economy   O
is   O
suspect   O
,   O
and   O
does   O
n't   O
see   O
much   O
revenue   O
growth   O
in   O
the   O
cards   O
.   O

He   O
also   O
said   O
that   O
the   O
price   O
wars   O
flaring   O
up   O
in   O
parts   O
of   O
the   O
computer   O
industry   O
will   O
continue   O
through   O
next   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
.   O

He   O
said   O
the   O
move   O
toward   O
standard   O
operating   O
systems   O
means   O
customers   O
aren't   O
locked   O
into   O
buying   O
from   O
their   O
traditional   O
computer   O
supplier   O
and   O
can   O
force   O
prices   O
down   O
.   O

That   O
,   O
he   O
said   O
,   O
is   O
why   O
Unisys   O
is   O
overhauling   O
its   O
whole   O
business   O
:   O
It   O
needs   O
to   O
prepare   O
for   O
a   O
world   O
in   O
which   O
profit   O
margins   O
will   O
be   O
lower   O
than   O

Statistics   O
on   O
acquisitions   O
by   O
foreigners   O
vary   O
in   O
detail   O
,   O
because   O
unlike   O
Sansui   O
,   O
which   O
is   O
listed   O
on   O
the   O
Tokyo   O
and   O

,   O
most   O
of   O
the   O
Japanese   O
companies   O
acquired   O
by   O
foreigners   O
are   O
privately   O
held   O
.   O

But   O
by   O
all   O
accounts   O
foreign   O
companies   O
have   O
bought   O
only   O
a   O
relative   O
handful   O
of   O
Japanese   O
companies   O
this   B-DATE
year   I-DATE

while   O
Japanese   O
companies   O
have   O
acquired   O
hundreds   O
of   O
foreign   O
companies   O
.   O

Nor   O
do   O
analysts   O
expect   O
the   O
Sansui   O
deal   O
to   O
touch   O
off   O
a   O
fresh   O
wave   O
of   O
foreign   O
purchases   O
.   O

If   O
the   O
strong   O
yen   O
and   O
the   O
high   O
stock   O
prices   O
of   O
Japanese   O
companies   O
weren't   O
deterrents   O
enough   O
,   O
webs   O
of   O
cross-shareholdings   O
between   O
friendly   O
Japanese   O
companies   O
and   O
fiercely   O
independent   O
Japanese   O
corporate   O
attitudes   O
repel   O
most   O
would-be   O
acquirers   O
.   O

Usually   O
when   O
a   O
Japanese   O
company   O
is   O
ready   O
to   O
sell   O
,   O
it   O
has   O
few   O
alternatives   O
remaining   O
,   O
and   O
the   O
grim   O
demeanors   O
of   O
Sansui   O
's   O
directors   O
at   O
a   O
joint   O
news   O
conference   O
here   O
left   O
little   O
doubt   O
that   O
this   O
was   O
not   O
the   O
company   O
's   O
finest   O
hour   O
.   O

Sansui   O
was   O
once   O
one   O
of   O
Japan   O
's   O
premier   O
makers   O
of   O
expensive   O
,   O
high-quality   O
stereo   O
gear   O
for   O
audiophiles   O
.   O

But   O
in   O
recent   B-DATE
years   I-DATE
,   O
the   O
market   O
has   O
moved   O
toward   O
less   O
expensive   O
``   O
mini-   O
component   O
''   O
sets   O
,   O
miniaturized   O
amplifiers   O
and   O
receivers   O

software   O
players   O
that   O
could   O
be   O
stacked   O
on   O
top   O
of   O
each   O
other   O
.   O

Some   O
of   O
Sansui   O
's   O
fellow   O
audio-specialty   O
companies   O
,   O
such   O
as   O
Aiwa   O
Co.   O
and   O
Pioneer   O
Electric   O
Corp.   O
,   O
responded   O
to   O
the   O
challenge   O
by   O
quickly   O
bringing   O
out   O
mini-component   O
products   O
of   O
their   O
own   O
,   O
by   O
moving   O
heavily   O
into   O
the   O
booming   O
compact   O
disk   O
businesses   O
or   O
by   O
diversifying   O
into   O
other   O
consumer-electronics   O
fields   O
,   O
including   O
laser   O
disks   O
or   O
portable   O
cassette   O
players   O
.   O

Sansui   O
was   O
late   O
into   O
the   O
mini-component   O
business   O
and   O
failed   O
to   O
branch   O
into   O
other   O
new   O
businesses   O
.   O

As   O
the   O
yen   O
soared   O
in   O
recent   B-DATE
years   I-DATE
,   O
Sansui   O
's   O
deepening   O
financial   O
problems   O
became   O
a   O
vicious   O
circle   O
.   O

While   O
competitors   O
moved   O
production   O
offshore   O
in   O
response   O
to   O
the   O
sagging   O
competitiveness   O
of   O
Japanese   O
factories   O
,   O
Sansui   O
lacked   O
the   O
money   O
to   O
build   O
new   O
plants   O
in   O
Southeast   O
Asia   O
.   O

What   O
's   O
more   O
,   O
the   O
bugs   O
only   O
emerge   O
on   O

Hewlett-Packard   O

Intel   O
is   O
n't   O
wholly   O
to   O
blame   O
for   O
the   O
snafu   O
.   O

The   O
real   O
culprits   O
,   O
they   O
said   O
,   O
are   O
computer   O
makers   O
such   O
as   O
IBM   O
that   O
have   O
jumped   O
the   O
gun   O
to   O
unveil   O
486-based   O
products   O
.   O

``   O
The   O
reason   O
this   O
is   O
getting   O
so   O
much   O
visibility   O

that   O
some   O
started   O
shipping   O

paying   O
the   O

for   O
taking   O
the   O
risk   O
.   O
''   O

In   O
late   B-DATE
September   I-DATE
,   O
IBM   O
began   O
shipping   O
a   O
plug-in   O
card   O
that   O
converts   O
its   O
PS/2   O
model   O
70-A21   O
from   O
a   O
80386   O
machine   O
to   O
an   O
80486   O
machine   O
.   O

An   O
IBM   O
spokeswoman   O
said   O
the   O
company   O
told   O
customers   O
Monday   B-DATE
about   O
the   O
bugs   O
and   O
temporarily   O
stopped   O
shipping   O
the   O
product   O

IBM   O
has   O
no   O
plans   O
to   O
recall   O
its   O
add-on   O
cards   O
,   O
the   O
spokeswoman   O
said   O
,   O
and   O
could   O
probably   O
circumvent   O
the   O
bugs   O
without   O
long   O
product   O
delays   O
.   O

``   O
We   O
do   O
n't   O
look   O
at   O
this   O
as   O
a   O
major   O
problem   O
for   O
us   O

Compaq   O

said   O
it   O
discovered   O

Because   O
of   O
the   O
glitch   O
,   O
however   O
,   O
the   O
company   O
said   O
it   O
does   O
n't   O
know   O
when   O
its   O
machine   O
will   O
be   O
commercially   O
available   O
.   O

That   O
's   O
a   O
break   O
from   O
Compaq   O
tradition   O
,   O
because   O
the   O
company   O
does   O
n't   O
announce   O
products   O
until   O
they   O
're   O
actually   O
at   O
the   O
dealers   O
.   O

The   O
problem   O
is   O
being   O
ballyhooed   O
,   O
experts   O
say   O
,   O
because   O
the   O
486   O
is   O
Intel's   O
future   O
flagship   O
.   O

Intel   O
's   O
microprocessors   O
are   O
the   O
chips   O
of   O
choice   O
in   O
many   O
of   O
today   O
's   O
personal   O
computers   O

the   O
80486   O

more   O
than   O
four   O

many   O
as   O
on   O

at   O
15   O
million   O
instructions   O
per   O
second   O
,   O
or   O
MIPs   O
.   O

That   O
's   O
four   O
times   O
as   O
fast   O
as   O
the   O
386   O
.   O

Machines   O
using   O
the   O
486   O
are   O
expected   O
to   O
challenge   O
higher-priced   O
work   O
stations   O
and   O
minicomputers   O
in   O
applications   O
such   O
as   O
so-called   O

groups   O
of   O
computers   O
together   O
,   O
and   O
in   O
computer-aided   O
design   O
.   O

But   O
while   O
the   O
chip   O
's   O
speed   O
in   O
processing   O
power   O
is   O
dazzling   O
,   O
it   O
's   O
real   O
strength   O
lies   O
in   O
its   O
software   O
inheritance   O
.   O

The   O
486   O
is   O
the   O
descendant   O
of   O
a   O
long   O
series   O
of   O
Intel   O
chips   O
that   O
began   O
dominating   O
the   O
market   O
ever   O
since   O
IBM   O
picked   O
the   O
16-bit   O
8088   O
chip   O
for   O
its   O
first   O
personal   O
computer   O

and   O
is   O
slower   O
than   O
newer   O

32-bit   O

Since   O
then   O
,   O
Intel   O
has   O
cornered   O
a   O
large   O

of   O
the   O

of   O
which   O
can   O
run   O
software   O
written   O
for   O

That   O
's   O
what   O
will   O
keep   O

coming   O
in   O

of   O

The   O
main   O
thing   O
is   O
to   O
stop   O
the   O

out   O

''   O

The   O
naval   O
interdiction   O
force   O
is   O
part   O
of   O
an   O
overall   O
American   O
strategy   O
that   O
officials   O
say   O
is   O
designed   O
to   O
leave   O
the   O
Iraqi   O
leader   O
with   O
only   O
the   O
stark   O
choice   O
of   O
backing   O
out   O
of   O
Kuwait   O
or   O
launching   O
new   O
attacks   O
to   O
change   O
his   O
situation   O
.   O

Though   O
they   O
insist   O
they   O
are   O
n't   O
trying   O
to   O
lure   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
into   O
an   O
attack   O
,   O
officials   O
hope   O
that   O
if   O
he   O
strikes   O
again   O
,   O
the   O
U.S.   O
and   O
its   O
allies   O
will   O
have   O
such   O
an   O
impressive   O
force   O
in   O
place   O
in   O
Saudi   O
Arabia   O
that   O
they   O
will   O
be   O
able   O
to   O
crush   O
him   O
in   O
retaliation   O
.   O

Iraq   O
's   O
first   O
option   O
,   O
of   O
course   O
,   O
may   O
be   O
simply   O
to   O
sit   O
tight   O
and   O
hope   O
it   O
can   O
endure   O
a   O
trade   O
embargo   O
longer   O
than   O
the   O
West   O
can   O
live   O
without   O
Iraqi   O
and   O
Kuwaiti   O
oil   O
.   O

Speaking   O
on   O
the   O
ABC   O
program   O
,   O
Abdul   O
Amir   O
al-Anbari   O
,   O
Iraq   O
's   O
ambassador   O
to   O
the   O
U.N.   O
,   O
asserted   O
that   O
an   O
embargo   O
on   O
Iraq   O
could   O
plunge   O
the   O
U.S.   O
into   O
a   O
''   O
depression   O
''   O
and   O
the   O
rest   O
of   O
the   O
world   O
into   O
an   O
economic   O
``   O
crisis   O
.   O
''   O

Iraq   O
clearly   O
is   O
trying   O
to   O
woo   O
back   O
more   O
Arab   O
support   O
in   O
case   O
the   O
conflict   O
drags   O
on   O
,   O
hoping   O
that   O
its   O
neighbors   O
eventually   O
will   O
help   O
it   O
survive   O
a   O
prolonged   O
war   O
of   O
economic   O
attrition   O
with   O
the   O
West   O
.   O

So   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
on   O
Friday   B-DATE
tried   O
to   O
scare   O
other   O
Arab   O
leaders   O
into   O
supporting   O
him   O
by   O
calling   O
on   O
Arabs   O
to   O
rise   O
up   O
in   O
a   O
holy   O
war   O
against   O
leaders   O
who   O
invited   O
American   O
and   O
other   O
Western   O
soldiers   O
into   O
Saudi   O
Arabia   O
to   O
protect   O
the   O
oil-rich   O
kingdom   O
.   O

Then   O
yesterday   B-DATE
,   O
he   O
tried   O
to   O
entice   O
Arab   O
leaders   O
with   O
his   O
proposal   O
for   O
a   O
diplomatic   O
solution   O
linking   O
his   O
occupation   O
of   O
Kuwait   O
with   O
Israel   O
's   O
occupation   O
of   O
the   O
West   O
Bank   O
.   O

The   O
proposal   O
also   O
called   O
for   O
replacing   O
American   O
and   O
other   O
Western   O
troops   O
in   O
Saudi   O
Arabia   O
with   O
Arab   O
forces   O
.   O

The   O
Bush   O
administration   O
immediately   O
said   O
it   O
``   O
categorically   O
``   O
rejects   O
the   O
proposals   O
.   O

And   O
President   O
Bush   O
yesterday   B-DATE
,   O
asked   O
whether   O
he   O
was   O
at   O
least   O
glad   O
Iraq   O
is   O
discussing   O
negotiations   O
,   O
replied   O
:   O
``   O
I   O
do   O
n't   O
see   O
anything   O
to   O
be   O
pleasing   O
in   O
there   O
at   O
all   O
.   O
''   O

American   O
strategists   O
are   O
calculating   O
,   O
though   O
,   O
that   O
the   O
trade   O
sanctions   O
--   O
enforced   O
by   O
an   O
effective   O
though   O
perhaps   O
undeclared   O
naval   O
blockade   O
--   O
will   O
hold   O
tightly   O
enough   O
to   O
convince   O
Iraq   O
that   O
it   O
will   O
lose   O
in   O
the   O
long   O
run   O
by   O
simply   O
standing   O
pat   O
.   O

At   O
that   O
point   O
,   O
rather   O
than   O
go   O
through   O
the   O
humiliation   O
of   O
backing   O
out   O
of   O
Kuwait   O
,   O
the   O
Iraqis   O
might   O
well   O
conclude   O
that   O
they   O
need   O
to   O
lash   O
out   O
in   O
some   O
way   O
to   O
shake   O
things   O
up   O
.   O

In   O
that   O
event   O
,   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
appears   O
to   O
have   O
three   O
choices   O
.   O

The   O
first   O
would   O
be   O
to   O
launch   O
the   O
much-feared   O
direct   O
invasion   O
of   O
Saudi   O
Arabia   O
,   O
hoping   O
to   O
seize   O
some   O
Saudi   O
oil   O
fields   O
and   O
improve   O
his   O
bargaining   O
position   O
.   O

But   O
that   O
option   O
is   O
growing   O
less   O
and   O
less   O
likely   O
as   O
thousands   O
of   O
American   O
,   O
British   O
,   O
Egyptian   O
,   O
Syrian   O
and   O
Moroccan   O
forces   O
assemble   O
in   O
and   O
around   O
Saudi   O
Arabia   O
to   O
protect   O
the   O
kingdom   O
.   O

The   O
Saudis   O
even   O
have   O
in   O
their   O
possession   O
48   O
Kuwaiti   O
jet   O
fighters   O
,   O
virtually   O
the   O
entire   O
Kuwaiti   O
air   O
force   O
,   O
which   O
managed   O
to   O
escape   O
the   O
Iraqi   O
invasion   O
,   O
Saudi   O
officials   O
said   O
.   O

The   O
Saudi   O
``   O
window   O
of   O
vulnerability   O
...   O
is   O
closing   O
very   O
fast   O
,   O
''   O
Prince   O
Bandar   O
bin   O
Sultan   O
,   O
the   O
Saudi   O
ambassador   O
to   O
Washington   O
,   O
said   O
over   O
the   B-DATE
weekend   I-DATE
.   O

The   O
second   O
possibility   O
would   O
be   O
to   O
start   O
a   O
fight   O
with   O
Israel   O
,   O
in   O
hopes   O
that   O
all   O
Arabs   O
would   O
have   O
to   O
move   O
behind   O
Iraq   O
in   O
a   O
fight   O
against   O
their   O
common   O
Israeli   O
enemy   O
.   O

In   O
such   O
an   O
event   O
,   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
also   O
might   O
calculate   O
,   O
the   O
Saudis   O
would   O
be   O
under   O
pressure   O
to   O
kick   O
out   O
U.S.   O
troops   O
because   O
of   O
America   O
's   O
close   O
ties   O
with   O
Israel   O
.   O

Iraq   O
could   O
start   O
hostilities   O
with   O
Israel   O
either   O
through   O
a   O
direct   O
attack   O
or   O
by   O
attacking   O
Jordan   O
.   O

Israel   O
has   O
publicly   O
declared   O
that   O
it   O
will   O
respond   O
to   O
an   O
Iraqi   O
attack   O
on   O
Jordan   O
because   O
it   O
wo   O
n't   O
allow   O
Iraq   O
's   O
dangerous   O
army   O
to   O
take   O
control   O
of   O
Jordan   O
's   O
long   O
border   O
with   O
Israel   O
.   O

Iraq   O
's   O
third   O
attack   O
option   O
would   O
be   O
to   O
start   O
an   O
undeclared   O
war   O
on   O
the   O
U.S.   O
and   O
other   O
Western   O
nations   O
through   O
terrorism   O
.   O

Two   O
Middle   O
East   O
terrorists   O
with   O
records   O
of   O
successful   O
attacks   O
against   O
Western   O
targets   O
,   O
Abu   O
Nidal   O
and   O
Abu   O
Abbas   O
,   O
have   O
ties   O
to   O
Baghdad   O
.   O

And   O
even   O
terrorist   O
groups   O
that   O
opposed   O
Iraq   O
in   O
its   O
war   O
with   O
Iran   O
show   O
signs   O
of   O
swinging   O
behind   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
now   B-DATE
that   O
he   O
is   O
in   O
a   O
confrontation   O
with   O
the   O
U.S.   O
And   O
Iraq   O
still   O
has   O
thousands   O
of   O
Americans   O
and   O
other   O
Westerners   O
under   O
its   O
control   O
in   O
Iraq   O
and   O
Kuwait   O
.   O

They   O
are   O
n't   O
being   O
allowed   O
to   O
leave   O
and   O
could   O
become   O
hostages   O
.   O

If   O
Iraq   O
chooses   O
a   O
simple   O
war   O
of   O
nerves   O
and   O
economic   O
attrition   O
,   O
the   O
Bush   O
administration   O
knows   O
a   O
long   O
stalemate   O
could   O
try   O
the   O
patience   O
of   O
the   O
American   O
public   O
and   O
the   O
West   O
in   O
general   O
,   O
and   O
could   O
open   O
the   O
possibility   O
that   O
moderate   O
Arabs   O
--   O
even   O
including   O
Saudi   O
Arabia   O
--   O
might   O
drop   O
out   O
of   O
the   O
effort   O
against   O
Iraq   O
and   O
accept   O
some   O
deal   O
from   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
.   O

But   O
U.S.   O
officials   O
have   O
sized   O
up   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
as   O
a   O
man   O
who   O
,   O
despite   O
some   O
recklessness   O
,   O
will   O
back   O
down   O
if   O
he   O
must   O
.   O

``   O
This   O
is   O
a   O
guy   O
who   O
is   O
impulsive   O
,   O
and   O
therefore   O
capable   O
of   O
big   O
miscalculations   O
,   O
''   O
says   O
one   O
senior   O
administration   O
official   O
involved   O
in   O
managing   O
the   O
crisis   O
.   O

The   O
official   O
adds   O
,   O
though   O
,   O
that   O
``   O
at   O
the   O
same   O
time   O
,   O
we   O
think   O
he   O
is   O
someone   O
who   O
is   O
capable   O
of   O
rational   O
judgments   O
when   O
it   O
comes   O
to   O
power   O
.   O

And   O
when   O
he   O
finds   O
something   O
is   O
unprofitable   O
,   O
then   O
one   O
can   O
see   O
certain   O
accommodations   O
.   O
''   O

Thus   O
,   O
administration   O
aides   O
will   O
be   O
trying   O
to   O
calculate   O
whether   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
's   O
proposed   O
diplomatic   O
formula   O
for   O
getting   O
out   O
of   O
Kuwait   O
represents   O
the   O
first   O
sign   O
he   O
is   O
searching   O
for   O
a   O
way   O
out   O
or   O
simply   O
is   O
a   O
public   O
relations   O
stunt   O
.   O

There   O
are   O
disagreements   O
among   O
experts   O
about   O
how   O
much   O
pressure   O
will   O
be   O
needed   O
to   O
make   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
decide   O
he   O
's   O
up   O
against   O
the   O
wall   O
and   O
whether   O
simple   O
economic   O
pressure   O
will   O
ever   O
be   O
enough   O
.   O

The   O
biggest   O
worry   O
is   O
that   O
if   O
he   O
decides   O
he   O
needs   O
a   O
way   O
out   O
of   O
his   O
predicament   O
but   O
does   O
n't   O
see   O
a   O
face-saving   O
method   O
,   O
he   O
could   O
lash   O
out   O
in   O
dangerous   O
and   O
unpredictable   O
ways   O
.   O

U.S.   O
officials   O
claim   O
they   O
already   O
see   O
signs   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
is   O
getting   O
nervous   O
.   O

In   O
the   O
first   O
days   O
after   O
President   O
Bush   O
announced   O
the   O
dispatching   O
of   O
U.S.   O
troops   O
,   O
they   O
note   O
,   O
the   O
Iraqi   O
leader   O
made   O
several   O
nationwide   O
addresses   O
indirectly   O
--   O
having   O
them   O
read   O
by   O
a   O
television   O
announcer   O
.   O

``   O
That   O
shows   O
he   O
's   O
nervous   O
about   O
pinpointing   O
his   O
location   O
,   O
either   O
because   O
he's   O
afraid   O
we   O
'll   O
find   O
him   O
,   O
or   O
that   O
internal   O
enemies   O
will   O
,   O
''   O
says   O
one   O
U.S.   O
official   O
.   O

The   O
unpredictability   O
of   O
Iraq   O
's   O
leader   O
is   O
a   O
principal   O
reason   O
the   O
U.S.   O
is   O
going   O
to   O
such   O
great   O
lengths   O
to   O
build   O
a   O
mammoth   O
force   O
in   O
and   O
around   O
Saudi   O
Arabia   O
.   O

Pentagon   O
officials   O
say   O
the   O
goal   O
is   O
to   O
put   O
40,000   O
troops   O
in   O
the   O
region   O
by   O
the   B-DATE
end   I-DATE
of   I-DATE
the   I-DATE
month   I-DATE
.   O

But   O
the   O
administration   O
is   O
n't   O
putting   O
any   O
upper   O
limit   O
on   O
how   O
high   O
the   O
force   O
could   O
go   O
after   O
that   O
,   O
calculating   O
that   O
it   O
would   O
be   O
a   O
mistake   O
to   O
underestimate   O
and   O
an   O
advantage   O
to   O
keep   O
Saddam   O
Hussein   O
guessing   O
.   O

U.S.   O
commanders   O
in   O
charge   O
of   O
planning   O
for   O
Middle   O
East   O
crises   O
have   O
indicated   O
in   O
the   B-DATE
past   I-DATE
that   O
they   O
were   O
capable   O
of   O
deploying   O
as   O
many   O
as   O
300,000   O
troops   O
.   O

And   O
the   O
U.S.   O
is   O
taking   O
similar   O
steps   O
to   O
ensure   O
that   O
its   O
naval   O
force   O
is   O
adequate   O
to   O
carry   O
out   O
a   O
blockade   O
of   O
Iraq   O
and   O
support   O
a   O
war   O
if   O
necessary   O
.   O

Over   O
the   B-DATE
weekend   I-DATE
,   O
Pentagon   O
officials   O
confirmed   O
reports   O
that   O
a   O
fourth   O
U.S.   O
aircraft   O
carrier   O
--   O
the   O
John   O
F.   O
Kennedy   O
--   O
and   O
its   O
powerful   O
group   O
of   O
support   O
ships   O
could   O
head   O
for   O
the   O
Middle   O
East   O
within   O
a   B-DURATION
few   I-DURATION
days   I-DURATION
.   O

Three   O
other   O
carriers   O
and   O
their   O
escort   O
vessels   O
already   O
are   O
stationed   O
within   O

Chairman   O
Marc   O
Fournier   O
said   O
his   O
board   O
unanimously   O
rejected   O
as   O
too   O
low   O
the   O
$   O
1.77   O
billion   O
bid   O
by   O

At   O
a   O
news   O
conference   O
,   O
Mr.   O
Fournier   O
accused   O
Paribas   O
of   O
planning   O
to   O
pay   O
for   O
the   O
takeover   O
by   O
selling   O
parts   O
of   O
the   O
company   O
,   O
whose   O
interests   O
include   O
insurance   O
,   O
banking   O
,   O
tuna   O
canning   O
,   O
sugar   O
and   O
orange   O
juice   O
.   O

The   O
chairman   O
said   O
his   O
board   O
members   O
,   O
including   O
representatives   O
of   O
West   O
German   O
insurance   O
giant   O
Allianz   O
AG   O
and   O
French   O
banks   O
Credit   O
Lyonnais   O
and   O
Societe   O
Generale   O
,   O
hold   O
nearly   O
50   O
%   O
of   O
Navigation   O
Mixte   O
's   O
capital   O
.   O

Mr.   O
Fournier   O
said   O
that   O
as   O
Navigation   O
Mixte   O
chairman   O
,   O
he   O
is   O
prohibited   O
by   O
takeover   O
regulations   O
from   O
organizing   O
his   O
own   O
defense   O
or   O
doing   O
anything   O
besides   O
managing   O
current   O
company   O
business   O
.   O

But   O
sources   O
said   O
he   O
will   O
be   O
urging   O
his   O
allies   O
to   O
boost   O
their   O
stakes   O
in   O
Navigation   O
Mixte   O
,   O
which   O
is   O
being   O
traded   O
in   O
London   O
and   O
is   O
to   O
resume   O
trading   O
in   O
Paris   O
Tuesday   B-DATE
.   O

At   O
the   O
same   O
time   O
,   O
he   O
is   O
expected   O
to   O
seek   O
legal   O
and   O
regulatory   O
means   O
of   O
blocking   O
or   O
delaying   O
Paribas   O
's   O
bid   O
.   O

For   O
the   O
moment   O
,   O
the   O
sources   O
said   O
,   O
he   O
has   O
decided   O
against   O
seeking   O
a   O
white   O
knight   O
or   O
organizing   O
a   O
counterbid   O
for   O
Paribas   O
.   O

Mr.   O
Fournier   O
said   O
Navigation   O
Mixte   O
's   O
1989   B-DATE
unconsolidated   O
,   O
or   O
parent-company   O
,   O
profit   O
is   O
likely   O
to   O
be   O
4.7   O
billion   O
francs   O
(   O
$   O
754.4   O
million   O
)   O
,   O
up   O
from   O
633.8   O
million   O
francs   O
last   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
.   O

That   O
is   O
due   O
mostly   O
to   O
payments   O
from   O
Allianz   O
for   O
most   O
of   O
the   O
50   O
%   O
stake   O
it   O
has   O
agreed   O
to   O
acquire   O
in   O
Navigation   O
Mixte   O
's   O
insurance   O
business   O
.   O

Mr.   O
Fournier   O
said   O
the   O
exceptional   O
gain   O
would   O
mean   O
nearly   O
twice   O
as   O
high   O
a   O
dividend   O
this   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
as   O
last   B-DATE
.   O

If   O
holders   O
avoid   O
tendering   O
to   O
Paribas   O
,   O
he   O
added   O
,   O
they   O
can   O
expect   O
strong   O
dividends   O
again   O
next   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
.   O

Analysts   O
noted   O
that   O
over   O
the   B-DURATION
past   I-DURATION
20   I-DURATION
years   I-DURATION
,   O
Mr.   O
Fournier   O
has   O
built   O
his   O
company   O
through   O
astute   O
stock-market   O
activity   O
and   O
has   O
warded   O
off   O
at   O
least   O
three   O
takeover   O
attempts   O
.   O

This   O
time   O
,   O
however   O
,   O
some   O
analysts   O
think   O
he   O
could   O
face   O
a   O
real   O
battle   O
.   O

``   O
Without   O
some   O
unexpected   O
``   O
coup   O
de   O
theatre   O
''   O
,   O
I   O
do   O
n't   O
see   O
what   O
will   O
block   O
the   O
Paribas   O
bid   O
,   O
''   O
said   O
Philippe   O
de   O
Cholet   O
,   O
analyst   O
at   O
the   O
brokerage   O
Cholet-Dupont   O
amp   O
Cie.   O
Mr.   O
de   O
Cholet   O
said   O
Mr.   O
Fournier   O
's   O
biggest   O
hope   O
was   O
to   O
somehow   O
persuade   O
regulatory   O
authorities   O
to   O
block   O
the   O
bid   O
.   O

Paribas   O
still   O
needs   O
the   O
go-ahead   O
from   O
the   O
Commission   O
des   O
Operations   O
de   O
Bourse   O
,   O
a   O
government   O
regulatory   O
agency   O
,   O
but   O
analysts   O
said   O
that   O
is   O
considered   O
likely   O
.   O

Mr.   O
Fournier   O
also   O
noted   O
that   O
Navigation   O
Mixte   O
joined   O
Paribas   O
's   O
core   O
of   O
shareholders   O
when   O
Paribas   O
was   O
denationalized   O
in   O
1987   B-DATE
,   O
and   O
said   O
it   O
now   B-DATE
holds   O
just   O
under   O
5   O
%   O
of   O
Paribas   O
's   O
shares   O
.   O

Once   O
he   O
realized   O
that   O
Paribas   O
's   O
intentions   O
were   O
n't   O
friendly   O
,   O
he   O
said   O
,   O
but   O
before   O
the   O
bid   O
was   O
launched   O
,   O
he   O
sought   O
approval   O
to   O
boost   O
his   O
Paribas   O
stake   O
above   O
10   O
%   O
.   O

The   O
petition   O
is   O
still   O
pending   O
,   O
but   O
Mr.   O
Fournier   O
downplayed   O
the   O
likelihood   O
of   O
his   O
organizing   O
a   O
takeover   O
bid   O
of   O
his   O
own   O
for   O
the   O
much-larger   O
Paribas   O
.   O

One   O
big   O
question   O
now   O
is   O
the   O
likely   O
role   O
of   O
Mr.   O
Fournier   O
's   O
allies   O
.   O

Mr.   O
Fournier   O
said   O
the   O
large   O
institutions   O
that   O
hold   O
nearly   O
50   O
%   O
of   O
Navigation   O
Mixte   O
's   O

all   O
strongly   O
support   O
him   O
,   O
but   O
some   O
analysts   O
said   O
they   O
aren't   O
so   O
sure   O
.   O

Allianz   O
,   O
for   O
example   O
,   O
has   O
said   O
in   O
official   O
comments   O
so   O
far   O
that   O
it   O
will   O
remain   O
neutral   O
.   O

Paribas   O
is   O
Allianz   O
's   O
lead   O
French   O
bank   O
.   O

Paribas   O
said   O
Monday   B-DATE
that   O
it   O
intends   O
to   O
bid   O
to   O
boost   O
its   O
stake   O
in   O
Navigation   O
Mixte   O
to   O
66.7   O
%   O
,   O
from   O
the   O
18.7   O
%   O
it   O
already   O
owns   O
.   O

The   O
purchase   O
of   O
the   O
additional   O
48   O
%   O

is   O
expected   O
to   O
cost   O
more   O
than   O
11   O
billion   O
francs   O
(   O
$   O
1.77   O

Paribas   O
says   O
it   O
will   O
offer   O
1,850   O

appeared   O

He   O
said   O
he   O
received   O
information   O
from   O
Khmer   O
Rouge   O

on   O
where   O
the   O
body   O
had   O

recently   O
ordered   O
10   O

they   O
would   O

over   O

many   O

1.7   O

Cambodians   O

the   O

It   O
had   O
a   O

a   O

commercially   O

A   O

cloaked   O
the   O

So   O

the   O

But   O
there   O
are   O
doubts   O
about   O
whether   O
the   O
oil   O
companies   O
will   O
comply   O
,   O
especially   O
since   O

State-owned   O

Before   O

it   O
would   O

the   O

By   O
congressional   O

the   O

Because   O

its   O
47,000   O

air   O
traffic   O

it   O
is   O
impossible   O

The   O

A   O
statement   O

an   O

However   O
,   O
there   O
was   O
confusion   O
later   O

the   O
Israeli   O

dropped   O
a   O

There   O
also   O
was   O
no   O

``   O

``   O
They   O

Mr.   O

notes   O
that   O
the   O

up   O

So   O
when   O

the   O
30   O
billion   O

-   O
a   O
figure   O
greater   O
than   O
the   O

was   O
no   O

It   O
was   O
a   O
glaring   O
hole   O

that   O
Apple   O

to   O
fill   O
the   O

the   O

one   O
step   O

Keep   O
is   O

simply   O
just   O
a   O
place   O
to   O
bank   O
whatever   O
random   O
half-thoughts   O

you   O

the   O

up   O

Everything   O
in   O

a   O
Microsoft   O

Swiping   O
left   O

no   O
longer   O
need   O

don't   O

to   O
erase   O
entirely   O

At   O
the   O
top   O
of   O
the   O
app   O
is   O
a   O
text   O
entry   O
field   O
that   O
serves   O
as   O
your   O
main   O
point   O
of   O
entry   O
for   O
all   O
new   O
notes   O

when   O

any   O

that   O
note   O
(   O

The   O
entire   O
experience   O
is   O
frictionless   O
.   O

That   O
said   O
,   O
it   O
's   O
not   O
going   O
to   O
conquer   O
the   O
world   O
quite   O
yet   O
.   O

Organization   O
options   O
are   O
limited   O
--   O
color   O
coding   O
is   O
your   O
only   O
choice   O
,   O
and   O
you   O
ca   O
n't   O
re-order   O
your   O
notes   O

Sharing   O
with   O
others   O
is   O
mostly   O
limited   O
to   O
email   O
and   O
Google+   O
,   O
and   O
the   O
desktop   O
features   O
are   O
pretty   O
bare   O
bones   O
.   O

But   O
that   O
's   O
more   O
a   O
function   O
of   O
it   O
being   O
new   O
,   O
rather   O
than   O
poorly   O
thought   O
out   O
.   O

Like   O
most   O
things   O
Google   O

expect   O
the   O
company   O

flesh   O
out   O

really   O
turn   O
it   O
into   O
our   O
personal   O
internet   O
junk   O
drawer   O
.   O

It   O
's   O
easy   O
to   O
foresee   O
the   O
day   O
the   O
when   O
users   O
will   O
be   O
able   O
to   O
send   O
anything   O
from   O
their   O
Web   O
browser   O

directly   O
to   O
Keep   O

The   O
prospect   O
of   O

incorporating   O

of   O
services   O
such   O
as   O
Pinterest   O

or   O
even   O
making   O
it   O
easy   O
to   O
catalog   O
streaming   O

,   O
could   O
turn   O
it   O
into   O
something   O
big   O

That   O
should   O
scare   O
Evernote   O

Keep   O

not   O
the   O

But   O
it   O
is   O
a   O
well-exectuted   O
refinement   O

In   O
filling   O
a   O

important   O
gap   O
in   O

All   O

four   O

And   O
the   O
dominant   O
flu   O
strain   O
early   O
in   O
the   O

But   O
it   O
does   O
track   O

people   O
65   O

and   O
those   O

Health   O
insurers   O
are   O
privately   O
warning   O
brokers   O
that   O
premiums   O
for   O
many   O
individuals   O
and   O
small   O
businesses   O
could   O
increase   O
sharply   O
next   B-DATE

health-care   O

that   O

could   O
more   O
than   O
double   O
for   O
some   O
consumers   O
buying   O
their   O
own   O
plans   O
.   O

The   O
projections   O
,   O
made   O
in   O
sessions   O
with   O
brokers   O
and   O
agents   O
,   O
provide   O
some   O
of   O
the   O
most   O
concrete   O
evidence   O
yet   O
of   O
how   O
much   O
insurance   O
companies   O
might   O
increase   O
prices   O
when   O

provisions   O

the   O

kick   O
in   O
next   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
\-   O
a   O
subject   O
of   O
rigorous   O
debate   O
.   O

The   O
projected   O
increases   O
are   O
at   O
odds   O
with   O
what   O
the   O
Obama   O
Administration   O
says   O
consumers   O
should   O
be   O
expecting   O
overall   O
in   O
terms   O
of   O
cost   O
.   O

The   O
Department   O
of   O
Health   O
and   O
Human   O
Services   O
says   O
that   O
the   O
law   O
will   O
``   O
make   O
health-care   O
coverage   O
more   O
affordable   O
and   O
accessible   O

''   O
pointing   O
to   O
a   O
2009   B-DATE
analysis   O
by   O
the   O
Congressional   O
Budget   O
Office   O
that   O

average   O

,   O
on   O
an   O
apples-to-apples   O
basis   O

would   O

The   O
gulf   O
between   O
the   O
pricing   O
talk   O
from   O
some   O
insurers   O
and   O
the   O
government   O
projections   O
suggests   O
how   O
complicated   O
the   O
law   O
's   O
effects   O
will   O
be   O

the   B-DURATION
next   I-DURATION
few   I-DURATION
months   I-DURATION
.   O

Part   O
of   O
the   O
murkiness   O
stems   O
from   O
the   O
role   O
of   O
government   O
subsidies   O
.   O

Federal   O
subsidies   O
under   O
the   O
health   O
law   O
will   O
help   O
lower-income   O
consumers   O
defray   O
costs   O
,   O
but   O
they   O
are   O
generally   O
not   O
included   O
in   O
insurers   O
'   O
premium   O
projections   O
.   O

Many   O
consumers   O
will   O
be   O
getting   O
more   O
generous   O
plans   O
because   O
of   O
new   O
requirements   O
in   O
the   O
law   O

The   O
effects   O
of   O
the   O
law   O
will   O
vary   O
widely   O
,   O
and   O
insurers   O
and   O
other   O
analysts   O
agree   O
that   O
some   O
consumers   O
and   O
small   O
businesses   O
will   O
likely   O
see   O
premiums   O
go   O
down   O
.   O

Starting   O
next   B-DATE
year   I-DATE
,   O
the   O
law   O
will   O
block   O
insurers   O
from   O
refusing   O
to   O
sell   O
coverage   O
or   O
setting   O
premiums   O
based   O
on   O
people   O
's   O
health   O
histories   O
,   O
and   O
will   O
reduce   O
their   O
ability   O
to   O
set   O
rates   O
based   O
on   O
age   O

That   O
can   O
raise   O
coverage   O
prices   O
for   O

while   O
reining   O
them   O

The   O
rules   O
can   O
also   O
affect   O
